Pericardiocentesis is draining fluid accumulated between the pericardium (heart sac) and the heart with a needle. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in pericardiocentesis procedures.

## What is Pericardiocentesis?

Pericardiocentesis is draining fluid accumulated in the pericardial space with a needle and catheter. It is performed for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

**Purposes of Pericardiocentesis:**

-   Diagnostic (fluid analysis)
-   Therapeutic (fluid drainage)
-   Emergency (tamponade)

## Causes of Pericardial Effusion

### Infectious

-   Viral pericarditis
-   Bacterial pericarditis
-   Tuberculous pericarditis

### Non-infectious

-   Malignancy
-   Uremia
-   Autoimmune diseases
-   Post-cardiac surgery
-   Trauma
-   Idiopathic

## Pericardiocentesis Indications

### Emergency Indications

-   Cardiac tamponade
-   Hemodynamic instability
-   Shock

### Elective Indications

-   Large effusion
-   Symptomatic effusion
-   Diagnostic purpose
-   Recurrent effusion

## How is Pericardiocentesis Performed?

### Preparation

-   Evaluation with echocardiography
-   Fluid localization
-   Coagulation control

### Procedure Techniques

**Subxiphoid Approach:**

-   Most common technique
-   Entry below xiphoid
-   Echocardiography-guided

**Apical Approach:**

-   Entry from heart apex
-   In selected cases

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: To entry site
2. **Needle entry**: Echocardiography-guided
3. **Fluid aspiration**: With syringe
4. **Catheter placement**: If needed
5. **Fluid drainage**: Complete drainage
6. **Catheter removal**: End of procedure

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 30-60 minutes

## Pericardiocentesis Results

### Success Rates

-   Technical success: >95%
-   Symptom improvement: >90%
-   Complication rate: <5%

### Fluid Analysis

-   Cytology
-   Biochemistry
-   Microbiology
-   Culture

## Complications

-   Heart perforation (rare)
-   Arrhythmia
-   Pneumothorax
-   Infection
-   Bleeding

## After Pericardiocentesis

### Follow-up

-   Echocardiography control
-   Fluid recurrence monitoring
-   Treatment of underlying cause

### Recurrent Effusion

-   Pericardial window
-   Pericardiectomy
-   Sclerotherapy
