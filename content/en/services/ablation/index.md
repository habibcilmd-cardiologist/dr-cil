    - question: "Does ablation provide permanent treatment?"
      answer: "For most SVTs, ablation provides permanent treatment. Recurrence may occur in AF and VT, but repeat ablation can be performed."
    - question: "Is ablation painful?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under sedation or general anesthesia. There may be a mild burning sensation during ablation."
    - question: "When can I return to work after ablation?"
      answer: "Most patients can return to normal activities within 2-3 days. Waiting 1-2 weeks is recommended for heavy physical work."
    - question: "Do I need to take medication after AF ablation?"
      answer: "Antiarrhythmic and anticoagulant drugs are used for the first 3 months. They may be reduced afterward based on doctor evaluation."
    - question: "What if ablation fails?"
      answer: "Repeat ablation can be performed or medical treatment can be continued. Surgical ablation may be considered in some cases."

Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat heart rhythm disorders (arrhythmias). In this procedure, radiofrequency or cryotherapy is applied to abnormal heart tissue causing the arrhythmia, providing permanent treatment. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in arrhythmia ablation.

## What is Catheter Ablation?

Catheter ablation is a procedure that destroys abnormal electrical pathways or foci causing arrhythmia by reaching the heart through thin catheters.

**Ablation Methods:**

-   **Radiofrequency ablation (RFA)**: Tissue burning with heat energy
-   **Cryoablation**: Tissue freezing with cooling
-   **Pulse field ablation (PFA)**: Tissue damage with electric field (new technology)

## Which Arrhythmias Are Treated with Ablation?

### Supraventricular Arrhythmias

**AVNRT (AV Nodal Reentrant Tachycardia):**

-   Most common cause of SVT
-   Ablation success rate >95%

**AVRT (AV Reentrant Tachycardia):**

-   Including WPW syndrome
-   Accessory pathway ablation

**Atrial Flutter:**

-   Cavotricuspid isthmus ablation
-   Success rate >95%

**Atrial Fibrillation:**

-   Pulmonary vein isolation
-   High success in paroxysmal AF

**Atrial Tachycardia:**

-   Focal or macroreentrant
-   Localization with mapping

### Ventricular Arrhythmias

**Ventricular Tachycardia (VT):**

-   Ischemic or non-ischemic
-   Substrate ablation

**PVC (Premature Ventricular Contraction):**

-   Symptomatic or high burden
-   Focal ablation

## Pre-Ablation Evaluation

### Diagnostic Tests

-   12-lead ECG
-   24-48 hour Holter
-   Echocardiography
-   Electrophysiology study (EPS)
-   Cardiac MRI (in some cases)

### Patient Preparation

-   Discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs
-   Anticoagulant adjustment
-   Fasting (6-8 hours)
-   Groin area shaving

## How is Ablation Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia + sedation (or general anesthesia)
2. **Vascular access**: Femoral vein (groin)
3. **Catheter placement**: To heart under fluoroscopy guidance
4. **Mapping**: Determination of arrhythmia source
5. **Ablation**: Energy application to target area
6. **Testing**: Verification that arrhythmia cannot be induced
7. **Catheter removal**: Hemostasis with pressure

### Procedure Duration

-   Simple SVT ablation: 1-2 hours
-   AF ablation: 2-4 hours
-   VT ablation: 3-5 hours

## Ablation Results

### Success Rates

| Arrhythmia Type | Success Rate |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| AVNRT           | >95%         |
| AVRT/WPW        | >95%         |
| Atrial Flutter  | >95%         |
| Paroxysmal AF   | 70-80%       |
| Persistent AF   | 50-70%       |
| VT              | 60-80%       |

### Recurrence Rates

-   SVT: <5%
-   AF: 20-30% (after single procedure)
-   VT: 20-40%

## Ablation Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Access site complications (bleeding, hematoma)
-   Heart perforation/tamponade (<1%)
-   AV block (may require pacemaker)
-   Stroke (in AF ablation)
-   Pulmonary vein stenosis (in AF ablation)
-   Esophageal injury (rare)

## Post-Procedure Care

**In Hospital:**

-   4-6 hours bed rest
-   Access site monitoring
-   Rhythm monitoring

**After Discharge:**

-   Avoid heavy activity for 1-2 weeks
-   Anticoagulant use (after AF ablation)
-   Antiarrhythmic drugs (temporarily)
-   Regular check-ups
