faq:
    - question: "What is IVUS?"
      answer: "IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound) is imaging of coronary arteries from inside the vessel using ultrasound. It shows vessel wall and plaque structure in detail."
    - question: "How is IVUS different from angiography?"
      answer: "Angiography shows the silhouette of the vessel lumen, while IVUS images vessel wall layers and plaque composition in 360°."
    - question: "When is IVUS performed?"
      answer: "It is used for evaluating ambiguous lesions, stent optimization, left main coronary disease, and complex cases."
    - question: "Is the IVUS procedure painful?"
      answer: "No, the procedure is performed under local anesthesia during angiography. The patient feels no discomfort."
    - question: "Is IVUS safe?"
      answer: "Yes, IVUS is a very safe diagnostic method. The risk of complications is very low."

IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound) is an advanced imaging method performed using ultrasound waves from inside the coronary arteries.

## What is IVUS?

IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound) is 360° imaging of the vessel wall and lumen by placing a miniaturized ultrasound transducer inside the coronary artery.

**Key Features:**

- **High resolution:** 100-150 microns
- **Penetration depth:** 4-8 mm
- **Imaging angle:** 360°
- **Catheter size:** 2.6-3.2 Fr

## IVUS vs Angiography

| Feature | Angiography | IVUS |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Imaging | Silhouette (2D) | Cross-sectional (3D) |
| Vessel wall | Invisible | Visible |
| Plaque analysis | Limited | Detailed |
| Lumen measurement | Relative | Absolute |
| Remodeling | Not observable | Observable |
| Stent assessment | Limited | Comprehensive |

## IVUS Indications

### Diagnostic Use

**1. Ambiguous Angiographic Findings:**
- Moderate stenosis (40-70%)
- Foreshortening/overlap lesions
- Calcified lesions

**2. Left Main Coronary Disease:**
- Critical location
- Treatment decision support
- Ostial lesions

**3. Plaque Characterization:**
- Stable vs Vulnerable plaque
- Lipid-rich plaque detection
- Fibrous cap thickness

### Interventional Use

**1. Stent Optimization:**
- Optimal stent selection
- Adequate expansion control
- Edge dissection detection
- Malapposition control

**2. Complex Interventions:**
- Bifurcation lesions
- CTO (Chronic Total Occlusion)
- Diffuse disease
- Left main stenting

**3. Stent Complications:**
- In-stent restenosis assessment
- Stent thrombosis cause investigation
- Neoatherosclerosis detection

## IVUS Technologies

### Mechanical (Rotating) IVUS

- Single element transducer
- Mechanical rotation
- High image quality
- 40-45 MHz frequency

### Electronic (Phased-Array) IVUS

- Multiple element array
- Electronic rotation
- Thinner catheter
- 20 MHz frequency

### Virtual Histology (VH-IVUS)

Color-coded display of plaque components:

- **Green:** Fibrous tissue
- **Yellow-Green:** Fibro-fatty
- **White:** Dense calcium
- **Red:** Necrotic core

## IVUS Procedure Process

### Preparation

1. Standard angiography access
2. Anticoagulation (heparin)
3. Intracoronary nitroglycerin

### Procedure Steps

1. **Coronary wire placement:** Distal to lesion
2. **IVUS catheter advancement:** Over wire
3. **Automatic pullback:** 0.5-1 mm/sec
4. **Image recording:** Throughout segment
5. **Measurements:** Lumen, vessel, plaque

### IVUS Measurements

**Basic Parameters:**

- **MLA (Minimum Lumen Area):** Narrowest lumen area
- **EEM (External Elastic Membrane):** Outer elastic membrane
- **Plaque Burden:** (EEM - Lumen) / EEM × 100
- **Stent Area:** Within stent boundaries

**Critical Values:**

| Parameter | Critical Threshold |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Left main MLA | <6 mm² |
| Proximal LAD MLA | <4 mm² |
| Other segments MLA | <4 mm² |
| Optimal stent expansion | >80% reference |

## IVUS-Guided Stenting

### Pre-PCI Assessment

- True lesion length
- Reference vessel size
- Plaque character
- Calcification degree

### Stent Selection

Based on IVUS measurements:

- **Stent diameter:** According to distal reference vessel diameter
- **Stent length:** Lesion length + 2-4 mm

### Post-PCI Control

**Optimal Stenting Criteria:**

1. **Adequate expansion:** MSA ≥ 80% reference
2. **Complete apposition:** No malapposition
3. **No edge dissection:** Longitudinal dissection check
4. **No geographic miss:** All plaque covered

## Clinical Benefits of IVUS

### Evidence-Based Data

**IVUS-XPL Study:**
- IVUS guidance vs Angiography
- 1-year MACE: 2.9% vs 5.8%
- 50% relative risk reduction

**ADAPT-DES Study:**
- Stent thrombosis risk reduction
- Importance of optimal expansion

### Clinical Advantages

- Better stent outcomes
- Reduced restenosis
- Lower stent thrombosis risk
- Optimal treatment decision

## IVUS Complications

### Rare Complications (<1%)

- Coronary spasm
- Dissection (catheter-induced)
- Air embolism
- Transient ischemia

### Precautions

- Adequate anticoagulation
- Intracoronary nitroglycerin
- Careful catheter manipulation

## IVUS vs OCT

| Feature | IVUS | OCT |
|---------|------|-----|
| Penetration | 4-8 mm | 1-2 mm |
| Resolution | 100-150 μm | 10-20 μm |
| Blood clearance | Not required | Required |
| Calcium measurement | Good | Excellent |
| Lipid plaque | With VH | Direct |
| Stent strut | Limited | Detailed |
