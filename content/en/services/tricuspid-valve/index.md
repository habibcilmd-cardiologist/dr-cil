faq:
  - question: "Is tricuspid regurgitation serious?"
    answer: "Severe tricuspid regurgitation can lead to progressive right-sided heart failure and reduced quality of life. Treatment options are tailored after a comprehensive evaluation."
  - question: "Do I always need surgery for tricuspid valve disease?"
    answer: "Not always. Depending on the cause and severity, medical therapy, rhythm/lead management, surgical repair/replacement, or transcatheter procedures may be considered."
  - question: "How are transcatheter tricuspid procedures performed?"
    answer: "They are typically performed through a vein in the groin (femoral vein) under advanced imaging guidance, often transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)."
  - question: "What symptoms suggest worsening tricuspid regurgitation?"
    answer: "Leg swelling, abdominal distension (ascites), fatigue, and shortness of breath on exertion are common symptoms."
  - question: "How is the best treatment option chosen?"
    answer: "Treatment is decided based on valve anatomy, right ventricular function, pulmonary pressures, comorbidities, and overall procedural risk—often through a multidisciplinary heart team."

The **tricuspid valve** sits between the **right atrium** and the **right ventricle** and ensures one‑way blood flow. In tricuspid valve disease, the most common problem is **tricuspid regurgitation (leakage)**; **tricuspid stenosis (narrowing)** is less frequent.

This page summarizes the medical background, diagnostic work‑up, and treatment options—including **repair** and **valve implantation/replacement**—with an emphasis on **modern transcatheter (catheter‑based) therapies** for selected patients.

## What Is Tricuspid Valve Disease?

Tricuspid valve disease refers to structural or functional abnormalities that:

- Prevent proper leaflet coaptation and cause **backward leakage** (regurgitation)
- Restrict the valve opening and limit forward flow (**stenosis**)

### Main forms

- **Tricuspid regurgitation (TR):** most common
- **Tricuspid stenosis (TS):** rare
- **Combined disease:** regurgitation and stenosis together

## Tricuspid Regurgitation

### Causes

TR is often classified as **primary (organic)** or **secondary (functional)**.

**Primary (organic) causes:**

- Infective endocarditis
- Rheumatic disease
- Congenital anomalies (e.g., Ebstein anomaly)
- Carcinoid syndrome
- Trauma
- Degenerative leaflet changes

**Secondary (functional) causes (more common):**

- Left‑sided heart disease with elevated pulmonary pressures
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right ventricular dilation/remodeling
- Long‑standing atrial fibrillation (atrial TR)
- Device leads (pacemaker/ICD) contributing to leaflet dysfunction in selected cases

### Symptoms

- Leg swelling
- Abdominal distension (ascites)
- Fatigue and reduced exercise capacity
- Shortness of breath on exertion
- Prominent neck veins

## Tricuspid Stenosis

Tricuspid stenosis is uncommon. Typical causes include rheumatic disease, carcinoid syndrome, and congenital conditions. Symptoms overlap with right‑sided congestion and heart failure.

## Diagnosis: How Is the Tricuspid Valve Evaluated?

The goals are to define **severity**, assess **right‑sided chamber impact**, and identify the **underlying mechanism**.

### Clinical evaluation

- Physical examination (murmur, signs of right‑sided congestion)
- ECG (rhythm assessment, especially atrial fibrillation)
- Blood tests (kidney/liver function, anemia, biomarkers as appropriate)

### Imaging and hemodynamics

- **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE):** first‑line tool
- **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE, often 3D):** detailed anatomy and procedural planning
- **Cardiac MRI:** right ventricular size/function assessment in selected cases
- **Cardiac CT:** annular sizing and anatomical planning when needed
- **Right heart catheterization:** pulmonary pressures/hemodynamics in selected patients

## Treatment Options

Treatment is individualized based on symptoms, TR/TS severity, right ventricular function, pulmonary pressures, valve anatomy, and comorbidities.

### 1) Medical therapy

- **Diuretics** for congestion
- Optimization of heart failure therapy
- Management of underlying drivers (rhythm control for AF when appropriate, treatment of left‑sided disease, pulmonary hypertension work‑up, etc.)

Medical therapy can improve symptoms but may not be sufficient in advanced structural disease.

### 2) Surgery: repair or valve replacement

- **Tricuspid valve repair (often preferred):** annuloplasty ring and leaflet techniques when feasible
- **Tricuspid valve replacement (valve implantation):** considered when repair is not feasible or has failed; bioprosthetic options are frequently discussed

### 3) Transcatheter (catheter‑based) therapies

For selected patients at high surgical risk, minimally invasive transcatheter approaches may be considered:

- **Edge‑to‑edge repair (TEER):** approximation of leaflets to reduce regurgitation (e.g., TriClip / PASCAL)
- **Annuloplasty systems:** device‑based annular reduction for suitable anatomy
- **Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR):** an option in selected anatomies and clinical settings
- **Caval valve implantation (CAVI):** a palliative approach aimed at reducing venous congestion by placing valve(s) in the venae cavae

Suitability is determined by detailed imaging (often 3D‑TEE and CT) and multidisciplinary heart‑team evaluation.

## Pre‑Procedure Work‑Up

Common elements include:

- Comprehensive echo (TTE + often TEE)
- Assessment of other valve lesions and coronary disease (when indicated)
- Kidney function and bleeding/thrombotic risk evaluation
- Review of anticoagulants/antiplatelets with individualized planning

## Risks and Recovery

Risk depends on the selected approach (surgical vs transcatheter) and patient factors. Examples include access‑site complications, arrhythmias, bleeding/clotting issues, and incomplete reduction of regurgitation. Recovery is typically faster with transcatheter procedures compared to open surgery.
