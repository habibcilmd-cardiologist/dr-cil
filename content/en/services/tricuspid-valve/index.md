Tricuspid valve disease is dysfunction of the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation is most common. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating tricuspid valve diseases.

## What is Tricuspid Valve Disease?

The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. In valve disease, this function is impaired and creates additional burden on the right heart.

**Types of Tricuspid Valve Disease:**

-   Tricuspid regurgitation
-   Tricuspid stenosis - rare
-   Combined tricuspid valve disease

## Tricuspid Regurgitation

### Causes

**Primary (Organic):**

-   Endocarditis
-   Rheumatic disease
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Trauma
-   Congenital anomalies

**Secondary (Functional):**

-   Left heart disease
-   Pulmonary hypertension
-   Right ventricular dilation
-   Atrial fibrillation

### Symptoms

-   Leg swelling
-   Abdominal swelling (ascites)
-   Fatigue
-   Shortness of breath
-   Neck vein distension

### Grading

| Grade    | Vena Contracta | Regurgitant Volume |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Mild     | <3 mm          | <15 ml             |
| Moderate | 3-6.9 mm       | 15-29 ml           |
| Severe   | ≥7 mm          | ≥30 ml             |
| Massive  | >14 mm         | >45 ml             |

## Tricuspid Stenosis

### Causes

-   Rheumatic disease
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Congenital

### Symptoms

-   Right heart failure signs
-   Hepatomegaly
-   Ascites

## Tricuspid Valve Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Systolic murmur (regurgitation)
-   Diastolic murmur (stenosis)
-   Neck vein distension
-   Hepatomegaly

### Imaging

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Transesophageal echocardiography
-   Cardiac MRI
-   Right heart catheterization

## Tricuspid Valve Disease Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Diuretics
-   Sodium restriction
-   Treatment of underlying disease
-   Heart failure treatment

### Surgical Treatment

**Tricuspid Valve Repair:**

-   Annuloplasty ring
-   Preferred method

**Tricuspid Valve Replacement:**

-   If repair not possible
-   Bioprosthetic valve preferred

### Interventional Treatment

**Transcatheter Tricuspid Interventions:**

-   TriClip
-   PASCAL
-   Emerging technologies

## Treatment Timing

Treatment decision depends on:

-   Presence of symptoms
-   Right ventricular function
-   Accompanying left heart surgery
-   Pulmonary pressure
