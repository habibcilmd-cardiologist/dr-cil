faq:
    - question: "What is a dialysis fistula?"
      answer: "A dialysis fistula is a surgically created connection between an artery and vein for hemodialysis. It provides high blood flow making dialysis possible."
    - question: "Why does a dialysis fistula become blocked?"
      answer: "Fistula blockage usually occurs due to stenosis, thrombosis, or central vein stenosis. Early detection through regular monitoring is important."
    - question: "Can a blocked fistula be opened?"
      answer: "Yes, most blocked fistulas can be opened using interventional methods. Balloon angioplasty, thrombectomy, and stenting can be performed."
    - question: "Can dialysis continue after fistula treatment?"
      answer: "After successful treatment, dialysis can usually continue the same day or the next day."
    - question: "Is fistula blockage treatment risky?"
      answer: "In experienced centers, it is a low-risk procedure. Success rate is between 85-95%."

Dialysis fistula treatment encompasses interventional procedures to maintain patency of AV fistulas and grafts, which are the lifeline for hemodialysis patients.

## What is a Dialysis Fistula?

An arteriovenous (AV) fistula is a vascular access created for hemodialysis in patients with chronic kidney failure.

**AV Access Types:**

| Type | Description | Advantage |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **AV Fistula** | Direct artery-vein anastomosis | Longest lifespan, less infection |
| **AV Graft** | Connection with synthetic tube | Quick use, easy cannulation |
| **Central Catheter** | Temporary access | Emergency use |

**Most Common Fistula Locations:**

1. **Radiocephalic (Brescia-Cimino):** Wrist level
2. **Brachiocephalic:** Elbow level
3. **Brachiobasilic:** With transposition

## Causes of Fistula Blockage

### Stenosis (Narrowing)

**Most common cause - 80%:**

- **Venous anastomotic stenosis:** At fistula outflow
- **Juxta-anastomotic stenosis:** Near anastomosis
- **Central vein stenosis:** Subclavian/innominate vein

### Thrombosis

- Acute fistula occlusion
- Usually secondary to underlying stenosis
- Clot formation due to low flow

### Other Causes

- Hypotension (during dialysis)
- Excessive compression
- Hypercoagulability
- Infection

## Signs of Fistula Problems

### Stenosis Signs

- Low flow during dialysis
- Prolonged bleeding time
- Swelling in fistula arm
- Decreased thrill (vibration)
- High venous pressure

### Thrombosis Signs

- Loss of thrill and bruit
- Hard, painful fistula
- Acute arm swelling
- Inability to perform dialysis

## Diagnostic Methods

### Physical Examination

- Inspection: Swelling, redness
- Palpation: Thrill assessment
- Auscultation: Bruit character

### Imaging

**Doppler Ultrasound:**
- First-line evaluation
- Flow velocities and volumes
- Stenosis localization

**Fistulography:**
- Gold standard
- Anatomical detail
- Same-session treatment possible

**Venography:**
- Central vein evaluation
- Collateral vessels

## Interventional Treatment Methods

### Percutaneous Transluminal Angioplasty (PTA)

**Primary treatment method:**

- Stenosis dilation with balloon
- High-pressure balloons
- Repeated inflations

**Success Rates:**

| Location | Technical Success | 6-Month Patency |
|----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Venous stenosis | 95% | 50-60% |
| Arterial stenosis | 90% | 60-70% |
| Central vein | 90% | 30-40% |

### Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB)

**Drug-coated balloon:**

- Paclitaxel-coated
- Restenosis reduction
- Improved long-term patency

### Stenting

**Indications:**

- PTA-resistant stenosis
- Elastic recoil
- Central vein stenosis
- Rupture risk

**Stent Types:**

- Bare-metal stent
- Covered stent (stent-graft)
- Self-expanding stent

### Thrombectomy

**For acute thrombosis:**

**Mechanical Methods:**
- Aspiration thrombectomy
- Rotational thrombectomy
- AngioJet

**Pharmacological Thrombolysis:**
- tPA infusion
- Pulse-spray technique

### Combined Approach

Typical treatment protocol:

1. Evaluation with fistulography
2. If thrombosis present: Thrombectomy
3. Stenosis identified: PTA
4. If needed: Stenting
5. Control imaging

## Treatment Outcomes

### Success Rates

| Procedure | Technical Success | 1-Year Primary Patency |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------------|
| PTA | 90-95% | 40-50% |
| DCB | 95% | 60-70% |
| Stent | 95% | 50-60% |
| Thrombectomy + PTA | 85-90% | 40% |

### Follow-up Protocol

- 1 month: Clinical evaluation
- 3 months: Doppler US
- 6 months: Doppler US or fistulography
- If problems develop: Urgent evaluation

## Complications and Management

### Early Complications

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Venous rupture | 2-5% | Prolonged balloon, covered stent |
| Distal embolization | 1-2% | Aspiration |
| Hematoma | 5% | Compression |
| Vasospasm | 5% | Nitroglycerin |

### Late Complications

- Restenosis: Most common, may require re-intervention
- Stent thrombosis: Thrombectomy + anticoagulation
- Infection: Antibiotic therapy

## Fistula Preservation Strategies

### Patient Education

- Fistula care
- Compression control
- Early symptom recognition

### Dialysis Unit Collaboration

- Regular flow monitoring
- Venous pressure monitoring
- Early referral

### Surveillance Program

- Doppler US every 3 months
- Dialysis parameter monitoring
- Proactive intervention planning

## Special Situations

### Central Vein Stenosis

- Subclavian/innominate vein
- Usually catheter history
- Stenting often required

### Steal Syndrome

- Cold hand, pain
- Banding or DRIL procedure
- Fistula ligation in severe cases

### Aneurysm

- True vs Pseudoaneurysm
- Treatment with covered stent
- Surgical repair
