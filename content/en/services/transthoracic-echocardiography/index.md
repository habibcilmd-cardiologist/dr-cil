faq:
    - question: "Is transthoracic echocardiography painful?"
      answer: "No, it is a completely painless and non-invasive procedure. Only a probe is placed on the chest."
    - question: "How long does TTE take?"
      answer: "A standard TTE procedure takes 20-45 minutes."
    - question: "Is preparation required before TTE?"
      answer: "Generally, no special preparation is needed. Comfortable clothing is recommended."
    - question: "Does TTE contain radiation?"
      answer: "No, ultrasound waves are used and it contains no radiation."
    - question: "When do TTE results come out?"
      answer: "Results are usually reported immediately after the procedure or on the same day."

Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is a non-invasive ultrasound imaging method used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. It is one of the most commonly used diagnostic tools in cardiology. Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in echocardiographic evaluation.

## What is Transthoracic Echocardiography?

TTE creates real-time images of the heart using ultrasound waves from the chest wall. Heart chambers, valves, walls, and blood flow can be evaluated.

**Advantages of TTE:**

-   Non-invasive and painless
-   No radiation
-   Real-time imaging
-   Bedside evaluation with portable devices
-   Repeatable

## TTE Indications

### Heart Structure Evaluation

-   Heart chamber sizes
-   Wall thickness
-   Congenital heart diseases
-   Pericardial effusion
-   Cardiac tumors

### Heart Function Evaluation

-   Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF)
-   Diastolic function
-   Regional wall motion abnormalities
-   Heart failure follow-up

### Valve Diseases

-   Valve stenosis
-   Valve regurgitation
-   Valve prolapse
-   Prosthetic valve function
-   Suspected endocarditis

### Other Indications

-   Hypertension evaluation
-   Cardiomyopathy
-   Aortic diseases
-   Pulmonary hypertension
-   Cardiac arrhythmias

## How is TTE Performed?

### Preparation

-   No special preparation required
-   Upper garments need to be removed
-   Left lateral decubitus position

### Procedure Steps

1. **Gel application**: Ultrasound gel is applied to the chest
2. **Probe placement**: Images obtained from different windows
3. **Imaging modes**: 2D, M-mode, Doppler
4. **Measurements**: Standard measurements and calculations
5. **Reporting**: Findings are reported

### Imaging Windows

-   Parasternal window (left sternal border)
-   Apical window (cardiac apex)
-   Subcostal window (upper abdomen)
-   Suprasternal window (neck)

## Parameters Evaluated in TTE

### Left Ventricle

-   Ejection fraction (EF) - Normal: 55-70%
-   End-diastolic diameter
-   End-systolic diameter
-   Wall thickness
-   Mass index

### Right Ventricle

-   Size and function
-   TAPSE (tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion)
-   Pulmonary artery pressure estimation

### Valves

-   Morphology
-   Flow velocities
-   Pressure gradients
-   Valve area
-   Regurgitation severity

### Aorta and Pulmonary Artery

-   Aortic root diameter
-   Pulmonary artery diameter
-   Flow pattern

## Types of TTE

### Standard TTE

-   Routine cardiological evaluation
-   Most commonly used method

### Contrast Echocardiography

-   Left ventricular border definition
-   Intracardiac shunt evaluation
-   Myocardial perfusion assessment

### Strain Echocardiography

-   Myocardial deformation analysis
-   Detection of subclinical dysfunction
-   Chemotherapy cardiotoxicity monitoring

## TTE vs TEE Comparison

| Feature | TTE | TEE |
|---------|-----|-----|
| Approach | Chest wall | Esophagus |
| Invasiveness | Non-invasive | Semi-invasive |
| Sedation | Not required | May be required |
| Image quality | Good | Excellent |
| Posterior structures | Limited | Superior |
