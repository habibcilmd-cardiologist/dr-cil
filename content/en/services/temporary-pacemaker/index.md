A temporary pacemaker is a device used to support heart rhythm in emergencies or until a permanent pacemaker is implanted. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in temporary pacing procedures.

## What is a Temporary Pacemaker?

A temporary pacemaker is a system that provides external electrical stimulation to ensure the heart beats at an adequate rate. Unlike a permanent pacemaker, the generator is located outside the body.

**Types of Temporary Pacing:**

-   **Transvenous pacing**: Electrode placement in heart via blood vessel
-   **Transcutaneous pacing**: Pacing through electrodes on skin
-   **Epicardial pacing**: Used after cardiac surgery

## Temporary Pacemaker Indications

### Emergency Indications

**Symptomatic Bradycardia:**

-   Syncope or presyncope
-   Hypotension
-   Heart failure signs
-   Altered consciousness

**Specific Conditions:**

-   Complete AV block
-   Mobitz type II AV block
-   Sinus arrest
-   Symptomatic sick sinus syndrome
-   Acute myocardial infarction + conduction disturbance

### Prophylactic Indications

-   Bridge therapy until permanent pacemaker implantation
-   Before high-risk cardiac procedures
-   Drug intoxication (beta blocker, calcium channel blocker)
-   Until electrolyte abnormalities are corrected

## Transvenous Temporary Pacing

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Internal jugular, subclavian, or femoral vein
2. **Electrode placement**: Under fluoroscopy or ECG guidance
3. **Right ventricular apex placement**: For optimal pacing
4. **Threshold testing**: Determination of pacing and sensing thresholds
5. **Generator connection**: Connection to external pacemaker device
6. **Fixation**: Prevention of electrode displacement

### Pacing Parameters

| Parameter   | Typical Value |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| Rate        | 60-80/min     |
| Output      | 2-5 mA        |
| Sensitivity | 2-5 mV        |
| Mode        | VVI or DDD    |

## Transcutaneous Pacing

### Use Cases

-   First intervention in emergencies
-   Bridge until transvenous pacing is prepared
-   Short-term pacing need

### Application

1. Adhesive electrodes placed on chest
2. Connected to defibrillator/pacemaker device
3. Rate and output adjusted
4. Capture verified

### Disadvantages

-   Can be painful (may require sedation)
-   Not suitable for long-term use
-   Capture reliability may be low

## Temporary Pacing Complications

### Access Site

-   Bleeding/hematoma
-   Pneumothorax (with subclavian access)
-   Arterial puncture
-   Infection

### Electrode Related

-   Electrode dislocation
-   Heart perforation
-   Tamponade (rare)
-   Arrhythmia induction

## Temporary Pacing Care

**Daily Checks:**

-   Pacing and sensing thresholds
-   Electrode position (X-ray)
-   Access site infection signs
-   Battery status

**Patient Care:**

-   Bed rest (with femoral access)
-   Prevention of electrode movement
-   Infection prevention measures

## Transition to Permanent Pacemaker

Temporary pacing is usually replaced with a permanent pacemaker in these situations:

-   Irreversible bradycardia
-   Pacing need longer than 48-72 hours
-   Inability to correct underlying cause

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="How long does a temporary pacemaker stay in?" >}}
Usually stays for a few days to 2 weeks. If a permanent pacemaker is needed, it is implanted as soon as possible.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Can I move with a temporary pacemaker?" >}}
Movement restriction is required to prevent electrode displacement. Bed rest is recommended with femoral access.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is temporary pacing painful?" >}}
Transvenous pacing is done with local anesthesia and is usually painless. Transcutaneous pacing can be uncomfortable.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How is the temporary pacemaker removed?" >}}
The electrode is gently pulled out and pressure is applied to the access site. It is usually a simple procedure.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is a permanent pacemaker needed after temporary pacing?" >}}
It depends on the underlying cause. If reversible causes are corrected, a permanent pacemaker may not be needed.
