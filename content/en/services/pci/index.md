faq:
    - question: "Is PCI surgery?"
      answer: "No, it is not open surgery. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed through catheter."
    - question: "How long will I stay in hospital after PCI?"
      answer: "In elective procedures usually 1-2 days, emergency procedures may require longer stay."
    - question: "Is PCI an alternative to bypass surgery?"
      answer: "In some patients, yes. Decision is made with patient-specific evaluation."
    - question: "When can I return to normal life after PCI?"
      answer: "Usually normal activities can be resumed within 1-2 weeks."
    - question: "Can PCI be repeated?"
      answer: "Yes, if needed, PCI can be performed again on different vessels or the same vessel."

PCI (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention) is catheter-based treatment of coronary artery disease. It includes balloon angioplasty and stent implantation. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in PCI procedures.

## What is PCI?

PCI is opening of stenosis or occlusion in coronary arteries through catheter. It is a minimally invasive treatment alternative to open heart surgery.

**PCI Components:**

-   Balloon angioplasty
-   Stent implantation
-   Atherectomy (if needed)
-   Intravascular imaging

## PCI Indications

### Acute Coronary Syndrome

-   Primary PCI (STEMI)
-   Urgent PCI (NSTEMI)
-   Unstable angina

### Stable Coronary Artery Disease

-   Severe stenosis (>70%)
-   Symptomatic patients
-   Positive stress test
-   Unresponsive to medical therapy

### Special Situations

-   Left main coronary disease
-   Multivessel disease
-   CTO (chronic total occlusion)
-   Bifurcation lesions

## Types of PCI

### Primary PCI

-   Emergency application in STEMI
-   Door-to-balloon time <90 minutes
-   Life-saving

### Elective PCI

-   Planned procedure
-   In stable patients
-   Optimal preparation

### Rescue PCI

-   After failed thrombolysis
-   Ongoing ischemia

## How is PCI Performed?

### Preparation

-   Evaluation with angiography
-   Antiplatelet loading
-   Anticoagulation

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Radial or femoral
2. **Guide catheter**: To coronary ostium
3. **Guidewire**: Crossing lesion
4. **Balloon angioplasty**: Predilation
5. **Stent placement**: Over lesion
6. **Postdilation**: Optimal expansion
7. **Control imaging**: IVUS/OCT

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 30-120 minutes

## PCI Results

### Success Criteria

-   Residual stenosis <20%
-   TIMI 3 flow
-   No complications
-   Symptom improvement

### Complications

-   Stent thrombosis
-   Dissection
-   Perforation
-   No-reflow
-   Side branch loss

## Post-PCI Follow-up

### Medication Therapy

-   Dual antiplatelet therapy (6-12 months)
-   Statin
-   Beta blocker
-   ACE inhibitor

### Lifestyle

-   Smoking cessation
-   Regular exercise
-   Healthy diet
-   Weight control
