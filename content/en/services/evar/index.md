    - question: "Is EVAR surgery?"
      answer: "No, it is not open surgery. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed through the groin."
    - question: "How long is recovery after EVAR?"
      answer: "Usually 2-3 days hospital stay is sufficient. Normal activities can be resumed within 2-4 weeks."
    - question: "Is EVAR permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, the stent-graft is permanent. Regular follow-up is required."
    - question: "Am I suitable for EVAR?"
      answer: "Decision is made by evaluating aortic anatomy. CT angiography is required."
    - question: "Can I have MRI after EVAR?"
      answer: "Most modern stent-grafts are MRI compatible. Consult your doctor."

EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) is catheter-based treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysm. It is a minimally invasive alternative to open surgery. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in EVAR procedures.

## What is EVAR?

EVAR is stent-graft placement into the aortic aneurysm through the groin. The aneurysm is supported from outside, eliminating rupture risk.

**Advantages of EVAR:**

-   No open surgery required
-   Minimally invasive
-   Shorter hospital stay
-   Rapid recovery
-   Less pain
-   Local anesthesia option in selected cases

## EVAR Indications

### Anatomical Criteria

-   Suitable proximal neck (length and angulation)
-   Adequate iliac artery diameter
-   Suitable access vessel condition (calcification, tortuosity)

### Patient Criteria

-   Aneurysm diameter ≥5.5 cm (male)
-   Aneurysm diameter ≥5.0 cm (female)
-   Rapidly growing aneurysm (>0.5 cm in 6 months)
-   Symptomatic aneurysm (pain, tenderness)
-   Review of co-morbidities

### EVAR vs Open Surgery

| Feature       | EVAR           | Open Surgery    |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| Incision      | Small (groin)  | Large (abdomen) |
| Anesthesia    | Local/Regional | General         |
| Hospital stay | 2-3 days       | 7-10 days       |
| Recovery      | 2-4 weeks      | 6-12 weeks      |
| Follow-up     | Regular CT     | Less frequent   |
| Mortality     | Lower          | Higher          |

## Pre-EVAR Evaluation

### Imaging

-   CT Angiography (mandatory)
-   Aortic anatomy assessment
-   Iliac artery evaluation
-   Renal arteries
-   Visceral arteries

### Patient Preparation

-   Kidney function tests
-   Cardiac evaluation
-   Anticoagulation adjustment
-   Hydration
-   Pre-op antibiotics

## How is EVAR Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local, regional, or general
2. **Femoral artery access**: Both groins
3. **Guidewire advancement**: To aorta
4. **Main body placement**: Over aneurysm
5. **Limb extensions**: To iliac arteries
6. **Balloon dilation**: For sealing
7. **Control angiography**: Result evaluation
8. **Closure**: Percutaneous or surgical

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 1-3 hours

## EVAR Results

### Success Criteria

-   Aneurysm exclusion
-   No endoleak
-   Stent-graft patency
-   Organ perfusion preserved
-   Aneurysm sac shrinkage

### Complications

-   Endoleak (most common)
-   Stent migration
-   Limb thrombosis
-   Kidney injury
-   Access site complications
-   Device failure

## Post-EVAR Follow-up

### Imaging Protocol

-   1 month: CT Angiography
-   6 months: CT Angiography
-   Annual: CT or Ultrasonography
-   Regular follow-up is lifelong

### Endoleak Types

| Type | Source                     | Treatment            |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| I    | Proximal/distal attachment | Urgent intervention  |
| II   | Side branches              | Usually surveillance |
| III  | Graft defect               | Intervention         |
| IV   | Graft porosity             | Surveillance         |
| V    | Endotension                | Evaluation           |
