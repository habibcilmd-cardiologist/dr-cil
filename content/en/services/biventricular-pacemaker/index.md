faq:
    - question: "Does a biventricular pacemaker cure heart failure?"
      answer: "CRT significantly reduces heart failure symptoms. In some patients, heart function may return to near-normal levels."
    - question: "Is biventricular pacemaker implantation painful?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. No pain is felt during the procedure, there may be mild discomfort afterward."
    - question: "How long does a biventricular pacemaker battery last?"
      answer: "CRT batteries typically work for 5-8 years. Battery life may be slightly shorter in CRT-D."
    - question: "What if I don't respond to CRT?"
      answer: "Optimization, electrode revision, or alternative treatments may be considered."
    - question: "Can I lead a normal life with a biventricular pacemaker?"
      answer: "Yes, you can continue your normal daily activities. Your exercise capacity may increase."

A biventricular pacemaker is a special device that improves heart function by stimulating both ventricles synchronously in heart failure patients. It is also known as cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT).

## What is a Biventricular Pacemaker?

Unlike a standard pacemaker, a biventricular pacemaker stimulates both the right and left ventricles simultaneously. This allows both sides of the heart to work in sync and increases pumping efficiency.

**Device Components:**

-   Generator (battery and electronic circuit)
-   Right atrium electrode
-   Right ventricle electrode
-   Left ventricle electrode (via coronary sinus)

## How Does a Biventricular Pacemaker Work?

Conduction delay (left bundle branch block) is frequently seen in heart failure:

-   Left ventricle contracts late
-   Heart works inefficiently
-   Symptoms worsen

Biventricular pacemaker:

-   Stimulates both ventricles simultaneously
-   Provides synchronized contraction
-   Increases cardiac output
-   Reduces symptoms

## Biventricular Pacemaker Indications

### Definite Indications

-   Sinus rhythm
-   Left bundle branch block (QRS ≥150 ms)
-   Ejection fraction ≤35%
-   NYHA class II-IV symptoms
-   Symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy

### Possible Indications

-   Wide QRS without left bundle branch block (≥150 ms)
-   Atrial fibrillation + low EF
-   Patients requiring high rate of ventricular pacing
-   Pacemaker upgrade (from existing pacemaker to CRT)

## Types of Biventricular Pacemaker

### CRT-P (Pacemaker)

-   Pacing function only
-   In patients with low sudden death risk
-   Smaller device
-   Longer battery life

### CRT-D (Defibrillator)

-   Pacing + defibrillation
-   In patients with high sudden death risk
-   Most commonly preferred type
-   Includes ICD function

## Biventricular Pacemaker Implantation

### Pre-Procedure Evaluation

-   Echocardiography (EF, dyssynchrony)
-   ECG (QRS width and morphology)
-   Coronary sinus anatomy (venography or CT)
-   Blood tests
-   Anticoagulant adjustment

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia + sedation
2. **Vascular access**: Subclavian or axillary vein
3. **Right atrium electrode**: Placement in right atrial appendage
4. **Right ventricle electrode**: To right ventricular apex or septum
5. **Left ventricle electrode**: To lateral vein via coronary sinus
6. **Testing**: Threshold and sensing check
7. **Generator implantation**: Placement in subcutaneous pocket
8. **Closure**: Skin closed with sutures

### Procedure Duration

Biventricular pacemaker implantation usually takes 2-4 hours.

## Biventricular Pacemaker Results

### Expected Improvements

**Short Term:**

-   Reduction in shortness of breath
-   Increase in exercise capacity
-   Improvement in quality of life

**Long Term:**

-   Increase in ejection fraction
-   Reduction in heart size
-   Decrease in hospitalization rate
-   Survival advantage

### Response Rates

-   70% of patients respond to CRT
-   30% may be "super responders"
-   30% may not respond adequately

## Biventricular Pacemaker Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Left ventricle electrode placement failure (5-10%)
-   Coronary sinus dissection
-   Phrenic nerve stimulation
-   Infection
-   Pneumothorax
-   Electrode dislocation
