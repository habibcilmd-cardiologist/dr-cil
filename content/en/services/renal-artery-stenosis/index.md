Renal artery stenosis is narrowing of the artery that supplies the kidney. It can lead to hypertension and kidney failure. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating renal artery stenosis.

## What is Renal Artery Stenosis?

Renal artery stenosis is more than 50% narrowing of the kidney artery. This condition reduces blood flow to the kidney and activates the renin-angiotensin system.

**Consequences of Renal Artery Stenosis:**

-   Renovascular hypertension
-   Ischemic nephropathy
-   Kidney failure
-   Heart failure

## Causes of Renal Artery Stenosis

### Atherosclerosis (90%)

-   Most common cause
-   Usually ostial
-   In elderly patients
-   Associated with other atherosclerosis

### Fibromuscular Dysplasia (10%)

-   In young women
-   Mid-distal segment
-   String of beads appearance
-   Better prognosis

### Other Causes

-   Arteritis
-   Dissection
-   Neurofibromatosis
-   Radiation

## Renal Artery Stenosis Symptoms

### Hypertension

-   Resistant hypertension
-   Young age onset
-   Sudden worsening
-   Kidney function deterioration with ACE inhibitors

### Kidney Findings

-   Kidney size asymmetry
-   Unexplained kidney failure
-   Recurrent pulmonary edema

## Renal Artery Stenosis Diagnosis

### Imaging

-   Doppler ultrasonography (screening)
-   CT Angiography
-   MR Angiography
-   Conventional angiography (gold standard)

### Doppler Criteria

| Parameter | Significant Stenosis |
| --------- | -------------------- |
| PSV       | >200 cm/s            |
| RAR       | >3.5                 |
| AT        | >0.07 s              |

## Renal Artery Stenosis Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Antihypertensive medications
-   Statin therapy
-   Aspirin
-   Risk factor control

### Endovascular Treatment

**Renal Artery Stenting:**

-   In atherosclerotic stenosis
-   In ostial lesions
-   Balloon angioplasty + stent

**Balloon Angioplasty:**

-   In fibromuscular dysplasia
-   Effective without stent
-   High success rate

## Renal Artery Stenting Procedure

### Procedure Steps

1. Femoral artery access
2. Renal artery angiography
3. Guidewire crossing
4. Balloon predilation
5. Stent placement
6. Control angiography

### Success Criteria

-   Residual stenosis <30%
-   Blood pressure reduction
-   Kidney function preservation

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is renal artery stenosis dangerous?" >}}
Yes, if untreated it can lead to kidney failure and uncontrolled hypertension.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How is renal artery stenting performed?" >}}
A stent is placed in the kidney artery through the groin. It is performed under local anesthesia.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does blood pressure decrease after stenting?" >}}
In appropriate patients, blood pressure control improves or medication need decreases.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is renal artery stent permanent?" >}}
Yes, the stent is permanent. Regular follow-up is required.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is treatment different in fibromuscular dysplasia?" >}}
Yes, usually balloon angioplasty alone is sufficient, stent is not needed.
