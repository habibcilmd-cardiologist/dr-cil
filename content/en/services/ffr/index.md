faq:
    - question: "What is FFR?"
      answer: "FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) is a pressure wire measurement that evaluates the functional significance of coronary stenosis. It shows how much the stenosis restricts blood flow."
    - question: "What does the FFR value mean?"
      answer: "FFR ≤0.80 indicates functionally significant stenosis and may require a stent. FFR >0.80 can be followed with medical therapy."
    - question: "How is the FFR procedure performed?"
      answer: "During angiography, a thin pressure wire is advanced beyond the stenosis. Hyperemia is induced with adenosine and pressure measurements are taken."
    - question: "How is FFR different from angiography?"
      answer: "Angiography shows the anatomical stenosis percentage, while FFR measures whether that stenosis actually restricts blood flow."
    - question: "Is FFR safe?"
      answer: "Yes, FFR is a very safe procedure. Adenosine may cause temporary chest tightness but it passes quickly."

FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) is an advanced diagnostic method that evaluates the functional significance of coronary artery stenosis.

## What is FFR?

FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve) is the ratio of maximum myocardial blood flow distal to a coronary stenosis to the maximum flow that should occur under normal conditions.

**Calculation:**

$$FFR = \frac{P_d}{P_a}$$

- **Pd:** Pressure distal to stenosis
- **Pa:** Aortic pressure
- **Condition:** Measured during maximal hyperemia

**Normal value:** FFR = 1.0 (no stenosis)

## Importance of FFR

### Anatomical vs Functional Assessment

Angiographic stenosis degree does not always reflect functional significance:

| Anatomical Stenosis | FFR ≤0.80 Frequency |
|---------------------|---------------------|
| 50-70% | ~35% |
| 70-90% | ~80% |
| >90% | ~95% |

**Clinical Conclusion:** Most moderate stenoses are not functionally significant.

## FFR Indications

### Primary Indications

**1. Moderate Stenoses:**
- Anatomically 40-70% stenosis
- Angiographic ambiguity
- Discordance with non-invasive tests

**2. Multivessel Disease:**
- Decision on which lesions to treat
- Complete vs Incomplete revascularization
- Treatment priority determination

**3. Left Main Coronary Disease:**
- Ostial/shaft lesions
- Ambiguous angiographic findings

**4. Serial Lesions:**
- Evaluation of multiple stenoses
- Determination of each lesion's contribution

### Special Situations

- Diabetic patients
- Post-CABG patient evaluation
- Post myocardial infarction
- Recurrent symptoms

## FFR Procedure Process

### Preparation

1. Standard coronary angiography access
2. Anticoagulation
3. 6Fr or 5Fr guide catheter

### Equipment

**Pressure Wire:**
- 0.014" diameter
- Distal sensor
- Optical or piezoelectric

**Hyperemia Agents:**
- Intravenous adenosine: 140 μg/kg/min
- Intracoronary adenosine: 100-200 μg
- Regadenoson: Single bolus

### Procedure Steps

1. **Calibration:** Equalization of pressure wire with aortic pressure
2. **Wire advancement:** 2-3 cm distal to stenosis
3. **Hyperemia induction:** Adenosine administration
4. **Measurement:** Stable Pd/Pa ratio recording
5. **Pullback:** Optional, for serial lesions

### FFR Value Interpretation

| FFR Value | Interpretation | Recommended Treatment |
|-----------|----------------|----------------------|
| >0.85 | Stenosis not significant | Medical therapy |
| 0.81-0.85 | Gray zone | Clinical decision |
| ≤0.80 | Significant stenosis | Revascularization |
| ≤0.75 | Definitely significant | Stent/CABG |

## FFR Evidence Base

### Landmark Studies

**FAME Study (2009):**
- FFR-guided vs Angiography-guided PCI
- 2-year MACE: 17.9% vs 22.4%
- Fewer stents, better outcomes

**FAME 2 Study (2012):**
- FFR ≤0.80: PCI vs Medical therapy
- Urgent revascularization: 1.6% vs 11.1%
- Study terminated early

**DEFER Study (2007):**
- FFR >0.75 → Stent deferral
- 15-year follow-up: Safety proven in deferred group

### Guideline Recommendations

**ESC/EACTS 2018:**
- Ischemia documentation with FFR: Class I, Level A
- In multivessel disease: Class I, Level A

**ACC/AHA 2021:**
- For moderate stenoses: Class IIa

## FFR Alternatives

### iFR (Instantaneous Wave-Free Ratio)

**Does not require adenosine:**
- Measurement during diastolic wave-free period
- Equivalent diagnostic accuracy
- Shorter procedure time

**Decision threshold:** iFR ≤0.89 → Revascularization

### QFR (Quantitative Flow Ratio)

- FFR calculated from angiography
- No wire required
- Estimated FFR value

### RFR (Resting Full-Cycle Ratio)

- Measurement at rest
- No adenosine required
- iFR-like results

## FFR Limitations

### Technical Limitations

- Presence of microcirculatory dysfunction
- High left ventricular pressure
- Severe tachycardia
- Diffuse disease

### Clinical Limitations

- Reliability decreases in acute MI
- No standardization in bypass grafts
- Presence of aortic stenosis

## FFR vs IVUS

| Feature | FFR | IVUS |
|---------|-----|------|
| Assessment | Functional | Anatomical |
| Hyperemia | Required | Not required |
| Plaque analysis | None | Detailed |
| Stent optimization | Indirect | Direct |
| Treatment decision | Clear threshold | Interpretation-dependent |

**Optimal Approach:** Treatment decision with FFR + Stent optimization with IVUS

## FFR Complications

### Adenosine-Related (Temporary)

- Chest tightness
- Dyspnea
- Flushing
- Bradycardia/AV block

### Wire-Related (Rare)

- Coronary spasm
- Dissection
- Wire fracture
