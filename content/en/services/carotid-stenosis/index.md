Carotid artery stenosis is the narrowing of the main vessels that supply the brain and is one of the most important causes of stroke. Approximately 200,000 stroke cases occur in Turkey each year, a significant portion of which are related to carotid disease. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in carotid stenting and offers modern treatment methods to reduce stroke risk.

## What is Carotid Artery Stenosis?

The carotid arteries are the main vessels located on both sides of the neck that supply most of the brain. Carotid stenosis is the narrowing of these arteries due to atherosclerosis.

Carotid stenosis can cause stroke in two ways:

1. **Embolic stroke**: Pieces breaking off from plaque blocking brain vessels
2. **Hemodynamic stroke**: Insufficient blood flow to the brain due to severe narrowing

## Symptoms of Carotid Stenosis

Carotid stenosis usually does not cause symptoms and is called a "silent killer." However, warning signs may be seen in some patients:

### Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

Also known as "mini stroke," TIA is a harbinger of stroke:

-   Sudden vision loss (in one eye)
-   Numbness/weakness in face, arm, or leg
-   Difficulty speaking
-   Loss of balance
-   Symptoms completely resolve within 24 hours

### Stroke Symptoms

-   Sudden facial drooping
-   Weakness in arm or leg
-   Speech disturbance
-   Vision loss
-   Severe headache

⚠️ **FAST Rule**: Face, Arm, Speech, Time - Call for emergency help with these symptoms!

## Risk Factors

Risk factors for carotid stenosis:

-   Advanced age (>65)
-   Smoking
-   Hypertension
-   Diabetes
-   High cholesterol
-   Coronary artery disease
-   Peripheral artery disease
-   Family history

## Diagnostic Methods

### Non-Invasive Tests

**Carotid Doppler Ultrasonography:**

-   First preferred screening method
-   Assessment of stenosis degree and plaque structure
-   Painless and radiation-free

**CT Angiography:**

-   Detailed anatomical imaging
-   Calcification assessment
-   For treatment planning

**MR Angiography:**

-   Contrast-free imaging option
-   Soft tissue details

### Invasive Diagnosis

**Cerebral Angiography:**

-   Gold standard
-   Can be done simultaneously with treatment

## Our Treatment Approaches

### Medical Treatment

Basic treatment in all carotid stenosis patients:

-   Antiplatelet therapy (aspirin, clopidogrel)
-   High-dose statin
-   Hypertension control
-   Diabetes management
-   Smoking cessation

### Carotid Stenting (CAS)

Minimally invasive endovascular treatment:

**Indications:**

-   Symptomatic patients: ≥50% stenosis
-   Asymptomatic patients: ≥70% stenosis (in selected cases)
-   High surgical risk patients
-   Post-radiation stenosis
-   Post-surgical restenosis

**How is the Procedure Performed?**

1. Access through groin artery
2. Placement of protective filter (embolic protection device)
3. Pre-dilation with balloon
4. Stent placement
5. Post-dilation with balloon
6. Filter removal

### Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA)

Surgical treatment option:

-   Surgical removal of plaque
-   Preferred in low surgical risk patients
-   Long-term results proven

## Stenting or Surgery?

Both treatments have advantages:

| Feature                    | Stenting (CAS) | Surgery (CEA) |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Invasiveness               | Minimal        | Open surgery  |
| Anesthesia                 | Local          | General/local |
| Recovery                   | Fast           | Longer        |
| Cranial nerve injury       | None           | Possible      |
| Myocardial infarction risk | Low            | Higher        |
| Stroke risk                | Similar        | Similar       |

The decision is made individually based on patient anatomy, risk factors, and preference.

## Carotid Stenting Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Stroke (1-3%)
-   Transient bradycardia/hypotension
-   Access site complications
-   Contrast nephropathy
-   Restenosis (rare)

## Post-Procedure Care

After carotid stenting:

**In Hospital:**

-   Neurological monitoring
-   Blood pressure control
-   Access site monitoring

**After Discharge:**

-   Dual antiplatelet therapy (at least 1 month)
-   Statin therapy
-   Risk factor control
-   Regular Doppler follow-up

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Does carotid stenosis always require treatment?" >}}
No, mild narrowings can be followed with medical treatment. Treatment decision is based on stenosis degree, presence of symptoms, and plaque characteristics.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does carotid stenting prevent stroke?" >}}
Yes, carotid stenting significantly reduces stroke risk in appropriate patients. However, medical treatment and risk factor control must continue.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Can I return to normal life after stenting?" >}}
Yes, most patients are discharged within 1-2 days and can return to normal activities within 1 week.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does the carotid stent last a lifetime?" >}}
Yes, the stent is permanent. With regular follow-up and medication use, it remains trouble-free for many years.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="What is done if both carotids are narrowed?" >}}
In bilateral stenosis, the more severe side is usually treated first. The second side is evaluated a few weeks later.
