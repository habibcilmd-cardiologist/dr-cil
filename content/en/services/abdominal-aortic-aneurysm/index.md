Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is abnormal enlargement of the aorta in the abdominal region. It is a serious condition that can be life-threatening due to rupture risk. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating abdominal aortic aneurysm.

## What is Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm?

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is enlargement of the abdominal portion of the aorta to more than 1.5 times its normal diameter. Normal abdominal aortic diameter is approximately 2 cm.

**Aneurysm Classification:**

-   Small: 3-4.4 cm
-   Medium: 4.5-5.4 cm
-   Large: ≥5.5 cm

## Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Causes

### Risk Factors

-   Smoking (most important)
-   Hypertension
-   Atherosclerosis
-   Family history
-   Advanced age (>65)
-   Male gender

### Other Causes

-   Infection (mycotic aneurysm)
-   Trauma
-   Connective tissue diseases
-   Vasculitis

## Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Symptoms

### Asymptomatic

Most aneurysms are asymptomatic and discovered incidentally.

### Symptomatic

-   Abdominal or back pain
-   Pulsating sensation (in abdomen)
-   Palpable mass

### Rupture Signs (Emergency)

-   Severe abdominal/back pain
-   Hypotension
-   Shock signs
-   Loss of consciousness

## Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Diagnosis

### Imaging

-   Ultrasonography (screening)
-   CT Angiography (gold standard)
-   MR Angiography
-   Conventional angiography

### Screening Recommendations

-   Men aged 65-75 who have smoked
-   Those with family history
-   One-time ultrasonography

## Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm Treatment

### Surveillance

**Small Aneurysms (<5.5 cm):**

-   Regular imaging
-   Risk factor control
-   Smoking cessation
-   Blood pressure control

### Surgical Treatment

**Open Surgical Repair:**

-   Traditional method
-   Repair with graft
-   Longer recovery time

### Endovascular Treatment

**EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair):**

-   Minimally invasive
-   Groin access
-   Stent-graft placement
-   Shorter recovery

## Treatment Indications

Treatment decision depends on:

-   Aneurysm diameter (≥5.5 cm in men, ≥5.0 cm in women)
-   Rapid growth (>0.5 cm/year)
-   Presence of symptoms
-   Anatomical suitability
