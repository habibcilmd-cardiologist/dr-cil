    - question: "What is a heart hole?"
      answer: "A heart hole is a congenital or acquired opening in the wall between heart chambers. ASD, VSD and PFO are the most common types."
    - question: "Can heart hole closure be done without surgery?"
      answer: "Yes, in suitable cases, heart holes can be closed through catheter using special closure devices without surgery."
    - question: "Why should PFO be closed?"
      answer: "PFO is associated with cryptogenic stroke and migraine. PFO closure in stroke patients reduces the risk of recurrent stroke."
    - question: "How long does the procedure take?"
      answer: "Catheter-based heart hole closure typically takes 1-2 hours and patients can be discharged the next day."
    - question: "Is the closure device permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, the device is permanent. Over time, the heart's own tissue covers the device and forms a natural wall."

Heart hole closure involves catheter-based treatment of congenital heart defects.

## What is a Heart Hole?

Heart holes are openings in the walls (septum) between heart chambers. These openings may be present from birth or develop later due to conditions such as heart attack.

**Types of Heart Holes:**

| Type | Full Name | Location |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **ASD** | Atrial Septal Defect | Between atria |
| **VSD** | Ventricular Septal Defect | Between ventricles |
| **PFO** | Patent Foramen Ovale | Between atria (unclosed fetal opening) |

### Normal Heart Anatomy

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │   Left Atrium   │
        │      (LA)       │
        ├────────┬────────┤
        │   ▼    │   ▼    │
        │  Left  │  Right │
        │Ventricle│Ventricle│
        │  (LV)  │  (RV)  │
        └────────┴────────┘
              │
         Septum (Wall)
```

**In Defects:**
- ASD: Opening between LA-RA
- VSD: Opening between LV-RV
- PFO: Fetal opening between LA-RA

## Atrial Septal Defect (ASD)

### What is ASD?

ASD is a hole in the wall between the two atria of the heart. It accounts for **10-15%** of congenital heart diseases.

### ASD Types

| Type | Frequency | Closability |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| **Secundum** | 75% | Catheter ✓ |
| **Primum** | 15-20% | Surgical |
| **Sinus Venosus** | 5-10% | Surgical |
| **Coronary Sinus** | <1% | Surgical |

**Secundum ASD:**
- Most common type
- Located in fossa ovalis region
- Most suitable for catheter closure

### ASD Symptoms

**In Childhood:**
- Usually asymptomatic
- Frequent respiratory infections
- Growth retardation (severe cases)

**In Adulthood:**
- Exercise intolerance
- Palpitations (atrial fibrillation)
- Shortness of breath
- Fatigue
- Paradoxical embolism risk

### ASD Complications

If untreated:
- Pulmonary hypertension
- Right heart failure
- Atrial fibrillation/flutter
- Paradoxical embolism (stroke)
- Eisenmenger syndrome (advanced stage)

### ASD Diagnosis

**Echocardiography:**
- Transthoracic (TTE): Initial assessment
- Transesophageal (TEE): Detailed anatomy
- Defect size and location
- Rim assessment

**ASD Closure Criteria:**
- Defect diameter: 5-38 mm
- Adequate rim: ≥5 mm
- Qp/Qs >1.5 (significant shunt)

## Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD)

### What is VSD?

VSD is a hole in the wall between the two ventricles of the heart. It is the **most common** congenital heart anomaly.

### VSD Types

| Type | Location | Catheter |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Perimembranous** | Membranous septum | Selected cases |
| **Muscular** | Muscular septum | ✓ |
| **Outlet (Supracristal)** | Outlet tract | Surgical |
| **Inlet** | Inlet tract | Surgical |

### VSD Symptoms

**Small VSD:**
- Asymptomatic
- Murmur only

**Medium-Large VSD:**
- Feeding difficulties
- Sweating
- Frequent respiratory infections
- Growth retardation
- Heart failure

### VSD Treatment Indications

- Qp/Qs >1.5
- Left ventricular dilation
- Signs of heart failure
- History of infective endocarditis

## Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)

### What is PFO?

PFO is an unclosed fetal passage between the atria that should close after birth but remains open.

**Epidemiology:**
- Present in **25%** of general population
- Mostly asymptomatic
- **40-50%** frequency in cryptogenic stroke

### PFO and Stroke Relationship

**Paradoxical Embolism Mechanism:**

```
Leg Veins → DVT
        ↓
   Right Atrium
        ↓
   PFO (open passage)
        ↓
   Left Atrium
        ↓
   Brain → STROKE
```

**High-Risk PFO Features:**
- Large PFO (>2 mm)
- Atrial septal aneurysm
- Significant right-to-left shunt
- Hypermobile septum

### PFO Closure Indications

**Definite Indications:**
- Cryptogenic stroke + PFO
- Age <60
- Other stroke causes excluded
- High RoPE score

**RoPE (Risk of Paradoxical Embolism) Score:**

| Feature | Points |
|---------|--------|
| No hypertension | +1 |
| No diabetes | +1 |
| No prior stroke/TIA | +1 |
| No smoking | +1 |
| Cortical infarct | +1 |
| Age 18-29 | +5 |
| Age 30-39 | +4 |
| Age 40-49 | +3 |
| Age 50-59 | +2 |
| Age 60-69 | +1 |
| Age ≥70 | 0 |

**RoPE ≥7:** PFO closure recommended

### PFO and Migraine

- Association between migraine with aura and PFO
- Improvement in some patients after closure
- Not a routine indication

## Catheter-Based Closure Procedure

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

**Assessment:**
- Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE)
- Defect size and anatomy
- Rim assessment
- Pulmonary pressure measurement

**Patient Preparation:**
- Fasting (6-8 hours)

| Gore Cardioform | Flexible, low profile |
| Occlutech | Nitinol mesh |
| Figulla Flex | Flexible structure |

**VSD Occluder:**
- Amplatzer VSD Occluder
- Muscular and perimembranous types

### Procedure Technique

**Steps:**

1. **Femoral vein puncture** (groin)
2. **Right heart catheterization**
3. **Transseptal crossing** (through defect in ASD/PFO)
4. **Defect sizing** (balloon)
5. **Appropriate device selection**
