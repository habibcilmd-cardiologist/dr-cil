    - question: "Is angioplasty a painful procedure?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and sedation, so no pain is felt. There may be brief chest pressure when the balloon is inflated."
    - question: "How long should I take medication after stenting?"
      answer: "Aspirin is for life, second antiplatelet drug (clopidogrel, ticagrelor) is usually taken for 6-12 months. Duration is adjusted based on individual risk assessment."
    - question: "Can I have an MRI after stent placement?"
      answer: "Yes, modern stents are MRI compatible. MRI can be safely performed 6 weeks after the procedure."
    - question: "Can I exercise after stenting?"
      answer: "Yes, exercise is possible after the recovery period. Safe exercise level is determined through cardiac rehabilitation program."
    - question: "Does the stent stay for life?"
      answer: "Yes, the stent is permanent and integrates into the vessel wall over time. With regular follow-up and medication, it remains problem-free for many years."

Coronary angioplasty is the procedure of opening blocked or narrowed coronary arteries using a balloon and stent. Also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), this treatment plays a life-saving role in the treatment of heart attack and angina.

## What is Coronary Angioplasty?

Coronary angioplasty is the procedure of opening narrowed or blocked coronary arteries through a catheter. During the procedure, a thin balloon catheter is placed inside the vessel, inflated to widen the narrowing, and usually a stent (metal cage) is placed to keep the vessel open.

This procedure makes treatment of coronary artery disease possible without requiring open heart surgery. First performed by Dr. Andreas Grüntzig in 1977, angioplasty is now one of the most frequently performed cardiac interventions.

## When is Angioplasty Needed?

Coronary angioplasty is performed in the following situations:

### Emergency Situations

-   **Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)**: Called primary PCI
-   **Unstable angina**: Chest pain not responding to medical therapy
-   **Cardiogenic shock**: Situations where the heart pump is inadequate

### Elective (Planned) Situations

-   Ongoing angina despite medical therapy
-   Significant ischemia findings on stress test
-   Functionally significant stenoses (FFR ≤0.80)
-   Symptoms affecting quality of life

## Pre-Procedure Preparation

A comprehensive evaluation is performed before angioplasty:

**Diagnostic Tests:**

-   Coronary angiography (visualization of stenoses)
-   Echocardiography (heart functions)
-   Blood tests (kidney function, blood count)
-   ECG

**Patient Preparation:**

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Loading dose of antiplatelet drugs
-   Precautions if contrast allergy exists
-   Informed consent

## How is Angioplasty Performed?

The procedure is performed in the catheterization laboratory:

### 1. Vascular Access

-   **Radial approach (wrist)**: Preferred method, fewer complications
-   **Femoral approach (groin)**: In complex cases or if radial is not suitable

### 2. Coronary Angiography

-   Guide catheter is placed at coronary artery ostium
-   Vessels are visualized by administering contrast agent
-   Location and severity of stenosis is determined

### 3. Balloon Angioplasty

-   Thin guidewire is passed through the stenosis
-   Balloon catheter is placed at the stenosis site
-   Balloon is inflated to compress plaque and widen vessel

### 4. Stent Placement

-   Stent is carried to stenosis site folded on balloon
-   Balloon is inflated to attach stent to vessel wall
-   Balloon is deflated and removed, stent remains permanently

### 5. Result Control

-   Result is evaluated with angiographic imaging
-   Optimal stent deployment is checked
-   Complication control is performed

## Types of Stents

Types of stents used in modern cardiology:

| Stent Type                    | Feature                      | Use Area                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Drug-Eluting Stent (DES)      | Low restenosis rate          | Standard choice             |
| Bare Metal Stent (BMS)        | Short-term antiplatelet      | High bleeding risk patients |
| Bioabsorbable Stent           | Dissolves over time          | Selected young patients     |

## Complex Angioplasty Procedures

Some situations require special techniques:

**Bifurcation Lesions:**

-   Stenoses at vessel branching points
-   Various stenting techniques (crush, culotte, T-stent)

**Calcified Lesions:**

-   Rotablation (high-speed rotating burr)
-   Intravascular lithotripsy (shock wave)
-   Cutting/scoring balloon

**Long Lesions:**

-   Overlapping stent technique
-   Long stent use

**Left Main Coronary Disease:**

-   High-risk procedure
-   Under intravascular imaging guidance (IVUS/OCT)

## Procedure Risks

Angioplasty risks are generally low:

-   Death risk (0.5-1%)
-   Myocardial infarction (1-2%)
-   Emergency bypass need (<0.5%)
-   Stent thrombosis (rare, <1%)
-   Contrast nephropathy (2-5%)
-   Access site complications (1-2%)

## Post-Procedure Care

Points to note after angioplasty:

**In Hospital:**

-   Post-procedure monitoring (4-6 hours)
-   Access site control
-   Mobilization

**After Discharge:**

-   Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)
-   High-dose statin therapy
-   Control of risk factors
-   Regular cardiology follow-up

## Long-Term Results

Excellent results are achieved with modern stents:

-   Technical success rate: 95-98%
-   Symptom improvement: 85-90%
-   Restenosis: 5-10%
-   Stent thrombosis: <1% (with regular medication use)
