    - question: "What is below-knee arterial occlusion?"
      answer: "It is the narrowing or blockage of the tibial arteries below the knee (anterior tibial, posterior tibial, peroneal) due to atherosclerosis. It is particularly common in diabetic patients."
    - question: "What are the symptoms of below-knee arterial occlusion?"
      answer: "Non-healing foot wounds, coldness and numbness in the foot, rest pain, and in advanced cases, gangrene are observed."
    - question: "What is the relationship between diabetic foot and below-knee vascular disease?"
      answer: "Most diabetic patients have below-knee vascular disease. Combined with peripheral neuropathy, wound healing becomes difficult and amputation risk increases."
    - question: "Is stenting performed in below-knee vessels?"
      answer: "Balloon angioplasty is generally preferred. In special cases, drug-eluting stents or bioresorbable stents may be used."
    - question: "Can the limb be saved with treatment?"
      answer: "Yes, with early and appropriate treatment, limb salvage rates in critical limb ischemia exceed 80-90%."

Below-knee arterial occlusion (infrapopliteal artery disease) is the narrowing or blockage of the tibial arteries below the knee due to atherosclerosis. It is particularly common in diabetic patients and is one of the most important causes of critical limb ischemia. Cardiology specialist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has specialized experience in interventional treatment of below-knee vascular diseases.

## Infrapopliteal Artery Anatomy

The below-knee (infrapopliteal) arteries consist of three main branches as a continuation of the popliteal artery.

**Anatomical Structure:**

```
Popliteal Artery
       ↓
Tibioperoneal Trunk
       ↓
    ┌──┴──┐
    ↓     ↓
Posterior  Peroneal
Tibial     Artery
Artery       ↓
    ↓     Ankle
Medial    lateral
Plantar   branches
   
Anterior Tibial Artery
    ↓
Dorsalis Pedis
    ↓
Dorsum of foot
```

**Vessel Characteristics:**

| Artery | Diameter | Length | Area Supplied |
|--------|----------|--------|---------------|
| Anterior Tibial | 3-4 mm | ~30 cm | Dorsum of foot |
| Posterior Tibial | 3-4 mm | ~25 cm | Sole of foot |
| Peroneal | 3-4 mm | ~25 cm | Lateral ankle |

## Why Are Below-Knee Vessels Important?

### Critical Limb Ischemia

Below-knee vascular disease is the most important cause of critical limb ischemia (CLI):

- **CLI definition:** Rest pain or tissue loss
- **Amputation risk:** 25-40% at 1 year without treatment
- **Mortality:** 50-70% at 5 years

### Diabetes and Below-Knee Disease

Below-knee involvement is very common in diabetic patients:

- 80% of diabetic PAD patients have below-knee involvement
- Medial calcification (Mönckeberg)
- Diffuse, multisegmental disease
- Poor collateral development

## Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Characteristic |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Diabetes** | Most important risk factor |
| **Chronic kidney disease** | Severe calcification |
| **Smoking** | Disease progression |
| **Advanced age** | >70 years |
| **Hyperlipidemia** | Plaque formation |

## Symptoms of Below-Knee Arterial Occlusion

### Critical Limb Ischemia Findings

**Rutherford Classification:**

| Category | Clinical Finding |
|----------|------------------|
| **4** | Rest pain |
| **5** | Minor tissue loss |
| **6** | Major tissue loss |

### Typical Symptoms

**Rest Pain:**
- Night pain (decreases when leg is lowered)
- In toes and forefoot
- May require opioid analgesics

**Tissue Loss:**
- Non-healing wounds
- Dry/wet gangrene
- Infection risk

**Diabetic Foot:**
- Neuropathic ulcers
- Charcot foot
- Osteomyelitis

## Diagnostic Methods

### Physical Examination

- Dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse
- Capillary refill time (>3 sec pathological)
- Foot color and temperature assessment
- Wound/ulcer examination

### Non-invasive Tests

**ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index):**

| ABI | Interpretation |
|-----|----------------|
| >1.30 | False high (calcification) |
| 0.91-1.30 | Normal |
| ≤0.40 | Critical ischemia |

**TBI (Toe-Brachial Index):**
- Digital arteries are less calcified
- TBI <0.70: PAD presence
- TBI <0.30: Critical ischemia

**Transcutaneous Oxygen Measurement (TcPO2):**
- Evaluates tissue perfusion
- <30 mmHg: Critical ischemia
- <10 mmHg: Difficult wound healing

### Imaging

**Doppler Ultrasound:**
- First step
- Flow patterns
- Limited imaging (calcification)

**CT Angiography:**
- Detailed anatomical map
- Calcification assessment
- Run-off vessel imaging

**DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography):**
- Gold standard
- Foot arch assessment
- Treatment in same session

## Angiosome Concept

The foot is divided into regions (angiosomes) supplied by different arteries:

| Angiosome | Feeding Artery |
|-----------|----------------|
| Dorsum of foot | Dorsalis pedis (Anterior tibial) |
| Sole (medial) | Medial plantar (Posterior tibial) |
| Sole (lateral) | Lateral plantar (Posterior tibial) |
| Heel (medial) | Calcaneal branch (Posterior tibial) |
| Heel (posterior) | Calcaneal branch (Peroneal) |

**Treatment Strategy:**
- Priority is opening the artery feeding the angiosome where the wound is located
- "Direct revascularization" principle
- Increases wound healing and limb salvage rates

## Endovascular Treatment

### Treatment Principles

1. **Opening at least one tibial artery** (to the foot arch)
2. **Angiosome-directed revascularization**
3. **Wound-directed approach**

### Balloon Angioplasty

**Standard Treatment:**
- Primary choice in below-knee vessels
- Good results without stenting
- Repeatable

**Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB):**
- Paclitaxel or Sirolimus
- Reduces restenosis rate
- Advantageous in long segment disease

### Special Balloons

| Type | Feature | Indication |
|------|---------|------------|
| Scoring balloon | Controlled dissection | Calcified lesion |
| Cutting balloon | Micro-atherotome | Ostial stenosis |
| High-pressure | 20-30 atm | Resistant stenosis |

### Stenting

**Below-Knee Stent Indications:**
- Flow-limiting dissection
- Elastic recoil
- Suboptimal angioplasty result

**Stent Types:**

| Type | Feature |
|------|---------|
| Coronary DES | Drug-coated, small diameter |
| Bioresorbable | Dissolves over time |
| Self-expanding | Long segment |

### Atherectomy

In calcified below-knee lesions:

- Orbital atherectomy (Diamondback)
- Rotational atherectomy
- Laser atherectomy

**Advantage:** Lumen preparation, increases balloon effectiveness

### Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) Techniques

**Approaches:**

1. **Antegrade:** From popliteal artery
2. **Retrograde (Pedal access):** From dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial
3. **Subintimal:** Controlled dissection

**Success rate:** 75-90% (in experienced centers)

## Treatment Outcomes

### Technical Success

- Balloon angioplasty: 90-95%
- CTO crossing: 75-90%
- Stenting: 95+%

### Clinical Outcomes

| Parameter | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Limb salvage (1 year) | 80-90% |
| Wound healing | 60-80% |
| Amputation-free survival | 70-80% |

### Patency Rates

| Treatment | 1 Year |
|-----------|--------|
| PTA | 50-60% |
| DCB | 70-80% |
| DES | 75-85% |

## Hybrid and Combined Approaches

### Multi-level Disease

Above-knee + below-knee disease often coexist:

```
Treatment Strategy:
1. First correct inflow (iliac/femoral)
2. Then open outflow (tibial)
3. Single session or staged
```

### Hybrid Procedures

- Femoral endarterectomy + Tibial angioplasty
- Iliac stent + Tibial DCB
- Bypass + Tibial angioplasty

## Complications

### Specific Risks

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Dissection | 10-20% | Long balloon, stent |
| Spasm | 5-10% | Vasodilator |
| Perforation | <1% | Long balloon |
| Distal embolism | 1-2% | Aspiration |
| No-reflow | 2-5% | Vasodilator |

### Access Complications

- In retrograde (pedal) access: Hematoma, AV fistula
- In antegrade access: Femoral complications

## Medical Treatment

### Mandatory Components

- **Aspirin:** 100 mg/day
- **Clopidogrel:** 75 mg/day (DAPT)
- **Statin:** High dose
- **ACE inhibitor:** Cardiovascular protection

### Diabetes Management

- Tight glycemic control
- Foot care education
- Regular podiatry check-ups
- Appropriate footwear

### Wound Care

- Debridement
- Infection control
- Offloading
- Multidisciplinary approach

## Surgical Alternatives

### Indications

## Follow-up Protocol

### Critical Limb Ischemia Follow-up

| Period | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| 2 weeks | Wound check |
| 1 month | Clinical + TcPO2 |

- **Infectious diseases:** Antibiotherapy
- **Plastic surgery:** Wound closure
- **Orthopedics:** Amputation decision (if needed)
- **Podiatry:** Foot care
