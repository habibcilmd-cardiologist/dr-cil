    - question: "What is the difference between EVAR and TEVAR?"
      answer: "EVAR is used for abdominal aortic aneurysms, while TEVAR is used for thoracic aortic aneurysms and dissections."
    - question: "Is EVAR/TEVAR surgery?"
      answer: "No, it is not open surgery. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed through the groin."
    - question: "How long is recovery after EVAR/TEVAR?"
      answer: "Usually 2-3 days hospital stay is sufficient. Normal activities can be resumed within 2-4 weeks."
    - question: "Is EVAR/TEVAR permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, the stent-graft is permanent. Regular follow-up is required."
    - question: "Am I suitable for EVAR/TEVAR?"
      answer: "Decision is made by evaluating aortic anatomy. CT angiography is required."
    - question: "Can I have MRI after EVAR/TEVAR?"
      answer: "Most modern stent-grafts are MRI compatible. Consult your doctor."

EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) and TEVAR (Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair) are catheter-based treatments of aortic aneurysms and dissections. They are minimally invasive alternatives to open surgery. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in both procedures.

## What are EVAR and TEVAR?

### EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair)
EVAR is used to treat **abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA)**. A stent-graft is placed into the abdominal aortic aneurysm through the groin.

### TEVAR (Thoracic Endovascular Aortic Repair)
TEVAR is used to treat **thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA)** and **aortic dissections**. A stent-graft is placed into the thoracic aorta through the groin.

**Common Advantages:**
-   No open surgery required
-   Minimally invasive
-   Shorter hospital stay
-   Rapid recovery
-   Less pain

## EVAR vs TEVAR: Key Differences

| Feature | EVAR | TEVAR |
| ------- | ---- | ----- |
| **Treatment Area** | Abdominal aorta | Thoracic aorta |
| **Indications** | AAA (Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm) | TAA, Type B Dissection, Traumatic aortic injury |
| **Critical Structures** | Renal arteries, iliac arteries | Subclavian artery, spinal cord |
| **Complication Risk** | Kidney injury, limb ischemia | Paraplegia, stroke risk |
| **Stent-Graft Type** | Bifurcated (forked) | Straight tubular |

## EVAR Indications (Abdominal Aorta)

### Anatomical Criteria
-   Suitable proximal neck (length and angulation)
-   Adequate iliac artery diameter
-   Suitable access vessel condition (calcification, tortuosity)

### Patient Criteria
-   Aneurysm diameter ≥5.5 cm (male)
-   Aneurysm diameter ≥5.0 cm (female)
-   Rapidly growing aneurysm (>0.5 cm in 6 months)
-   Symptomatic aneurysm (pain, tenderness)

## TEVAR Indications (Thoracic Aorta)

### Anatomical Criteria
-   Descending thoracic aortic aneurysm
-   Suitable proximal and distal landing zones
-   Adequate access vessels

### Patient Criteria
-   Thoracic aneurysm diameter ≥5.5-6.0 cm
-   Complicated Type B aortic dissection
-   Penetrating aortic ulcer
-   Traumatic aortic injury
-   Intramural hematoma

### EVAR vs Open Surgery

| Feature       | EVAR/TEVAR     | Open Surgery       |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Incision      | Small (groin)  | Large (abdomen/chest) |
| Anesthesia    | Local/Regional | General            |
| Hospital stay | 2-3 days       | 7-10 days          |
| Recovery      | 2-4 weeks      | 6-12 weeks         |
| Follow-up     | Regular CT     | Less frequent      |
| Mortality     | Lower          | Higher             |

## Pre-EVAR/TEVAR Evaluation

### Imaging

-   CT Angiography (mandatory)
-   Aortic anatomy assessment
-   Iliac artery evaluation
-   Renal arteries (for EVAR)
-   Cerebral vessels (for TEVAR)
-   Visceral arteries

### Patient Preparation

-   Kidney function tests
-   Cardiac evaluation
-   Anticoagulation adjustment
-   Hydration
-   Pre-op antibiotics
-   Spinal cord protection assessment (TEVAR)

## How are EVAR/TEVAR Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local, regional, or general
2. **Femoral artery access**: One or both groins
3. **Guidewire advancement**: To aorta
4. **Stent-graft placement**: Over aneurysm/dissection
5. **For EVAR**: Bifurcated graft with limb extensions
6. **For TEVAR**: Straight tubular stent-graft
7. **Balloon dilation**: For sealing
8. **Control angiography**: Result evaluation
9. **Closure**: Percutaneous or surgical

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 1-3 hours

## TEVAR-Specific Considerations

### Spinal Cord Protection
One of the most important complications in TEVAR is paraplegia (paralysis) risk. To reduce this risk:
-   Spinal drainage (when necessary)
-   Blood pressure control
-   Staged stenting approach

### Subclavian Artery Management
Coverage of the left subclavian artery may be necessary. In this case:
-   Pre-operative bypass may be performed
-   Parallel stent (chimney) technique can be used

## EVAR/TEVAR Results

### Success Criteria

-   Aneurysm/dissection exclusion
-   No endoleak
-   Stent-graft patency
-   Organ perfusion preserved
-   Aneurysm sac shrinkage

### EVAR Complications
-   Endoleak (most common)
-   Stent migration
-   Limb thrombosis
-   Kidney injury
-   Access site complications

### TEVAR Complications
-   Paraplegia/paraparesis
-   Stroke
-   Endoleak
-   Left arm ischemia
-   Retrograde type A dissection

## Post-EVAR/TEVAR Follow-up

### Imaging Protocol

-   1 month: CT Angiography
-   6 months: CT Angiography
-   Annual: CT or Ultrasonography
-   Regular follow-up is lifelong

### Endoleak Types

| Type | Source                     | Treatment            |
| ---- | -------------------------- | -------------------- |
| I    | Proximal/distal attachment | Urgent intervention  |
| II   | Side branches              | Usually surveillance |
| III  | Graft defect               | Intervention         |
| IV   | Graft porosity             | Surveillance         |
| V    | Endotension                | Evaluation           |
