Tilt table test (head-up tilt test) is a diagnostic test used to investigate the cause of unexplained fainting (syncope) episodes. It is the gold standard method for diagnosing vasovagal syncope. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in tilt test evaluation.

## What is a Tilt Table Test?

A tilt table test monitors changes in blood pressure and heart rate as the patient is moved from a horizontal to a vertical position. This test evaluates the body's response to position change.
