    - question: "What is acute DVT?"
      answer: "Acute DVT (Deep Vein Thrombosis) is a newly formed blood clot in the deep veins of the leg. Clots within the first 14 days are generally called acute."
    - question: "What are the symptoms of acute DVT?"
      answer: "Leg swelling, pain, increased warmth, redness, and difficulty walking are the most common symptoms."
    - question: "Is acute DVT dangerous?"
      answer: "Yes, if untreated, the clot can travel to the lungs causing pulmonary embolism. This is a life-threatening condition."
    - question: "How is acute DVT treated?"
      answer: "Blood thinners are the primary treatment. In severe cases, catheter-based clot dissolution or mechanical thrombectomy is performed."
    - question: "Does the leg return to normal after DVT treatment?"
      answer: "With early and aggressive treatment, most patients fully recover. Late treatment may lead to post-thrombotic syndrome."

Acute DVT treatment encompasses interventional procedures to dissolve newly formed clots in leg deep veins and prevent complications.

## What is Acute DVT?

Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is the formation of blood clots, usually in the deep veins of the legs. **Acute DVT** refers to thrombosis within the first 14 days from symptom onset.

**Thrombosis Locations:**

| Location | Frequency | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Iliofemoral | 25% | Highest PE risk |
| Femoral | 35% | High |
| Popliteal | 25% | Moderate |
| Distal (Calf) | 15% | Low |

## Acute DVT Risk Factors

### Virchow's Triad

Three fundamental factors for DVT development:

1. **Stasis:** Prolonged immobility
2. **Endothelial damage:** Vessel wall injury
3. **Hypercoagulability:** Increased clotting tendency

### Specific Risk Factors

**Transient:**
- Surgery (especially orthopedic)
- Long plane/car travel
- Immobilization
- Pregnancy/postpartum
- Oral contraceptive use

**Persistent:**
- Cancer
- Thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden, etc.)
- Antiphospholipid syndrome
- Previous DVT history

## Acute DVT Symptoms

### Clinical Findings

- **Swelling:** Unilateral leg edema
- **Pain:** Especially in calf
- **Warmth:** In affected leg
- **Redness:** Erythema
- **Homan's sign:** Calf pain with dorsiflexion

### Phlegmasia Syndromes

**Severe DVT forms:**

**Phlegmasia Alba Dolens:**
- Massive iliofemoral DVT
- Pale, painful leg
- Arterial circulation preserved

**Phlegmasia Cerulea Dolens:**
- Complete venous occlusion
- Cyanotic, severely painful leg
- Risk of arterial compromise
- **Requires emergency intervention**

## Acute DVT Diagnosis

### Clinical Scoring

**Wells Score:**

| Criterion | Points |
|-----------|--------|
| Active cancer | +1 |
| Paralysis or immobilization | +1 |
| >3 days bed rest or surgery | +1 |
| Deep vein tenderness | +1 |
| Entire leg swelling | +1 |
| Calf swelling >3 cm difference | +1 |
| Pitting edema | +1 |
| Collateral superficial veins | +1 |
| Alternative diagnosis more likely | -2 |

**Interpretation:** ≥2 points = DVT likely

### Laboratory

- **D-dimer:** Negative value excludes DVT
- Coagulation panel
- Thrombophilia screening (selected cases)

### Imaging

**Compression Ultrasound:**
- First-choice diagnostic method
- Sensitivity >95%
- Evaluates vein compressibility

**CT Venography:**
- Iliocaval involvement suspicion
- Pelvic pathology

**MR Venography:**
- Alternative method
- Non-contrast option available

## Acute DVT Treatment Options

### Anticoagulation (Primary Treatment)

**In all patients:**

**Initial:**
- LMWH (Low molecular weight heparin)
- UFH (Unfractionated heparin)
- Fondaparinux
- Rivaroxaban/Apixaban (direct)

**Maintenance:**
- Warfarin (INR 2-3)
- DOAC (Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, Edoxaban)

**Duration:**
- Provoked DVT: 3 months
- Unprovoked DVT: ≥6 months or lifelong
- Cancer-related: LMWH preferred

### Interventional Treatment Indications

**Consider catheter-directed treatment:**

1. **Iliofemoral DVT:** Proximal involvement
2. **Young patients:** <65 years
3. **Low bleeding risk**
4. **Symptom duration <14 days**
5. **Good functional status**
6. **Life expectancy >1 year**

**Absolute Indication:**
- Phlegmasia cerulea dolens
- Venous gangrene risk

## Interventional Treatment Methods

### Catheter-Directed Thrombolysis (CDT)

**Standard interventional approach:**

**Technique:**
1. Popliteal or jugular access
2. Catheter placement within clot
3. tPA (Alteplase) infusion
4. 12-24 hour infusion
5. Control venography
6. If residual stenosis: Balloon/Stent

**Dosage:**
- tPA: 0.5-1 mg/hour
- Concurrent heparin infusion

### Pharmacomechanical Thrombolysis (PMT)

**Mechanical + Pharmacological:**

**Devices:**
- **EKOS:** Ultrasound-assisted thrombolysis
- **AngioJet:** Rheolytic thrombectomy
- **Trellis:** Isolated segment thrombolysis

**Advantages:**
- Shorter procedure time
- Lower lytic agent dose
- Reduced bleeding risk

### Percutaneous Mechanical Thrombectomy (PMT)

**Mechanical only:**

- AngioJet
- Aspiration thrombectomy
- ClotTriever

**Advantage:** No lytic agent used (in high bleeding risk patients)

### Venous Stenting

**Indications:**

- Residual stenosis >50%
- May-Thurner syndrome
- Post-thrombotic stenosis

**Stent Types:**
- Self-expanding venous stents
- Wallstent
- Veniti Vici

## IVC Filter

### Indications

**Absolute:**
- Anticoagulation contraindicated
- Recurrent PE despite anticoagulation
- Protection during thrombectomy

**Relative:**
- Massive iliofemoral DVT
- Free-floating thrombus

### Filter Types

- **Permanent:** Lifelong
- **Retrievable:** Temporary protection

## Treatment Outcomes

### CDT/PMT Outcomes

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Complete/Partial lysis | 80-90% |
| Iliofemoral patency (1 year) | 70-80% |
| PTS reduction | 40-50% |
| Major bleeding | 5-10% |

### ATTRACT Trial

- Pharmacomechanical treatment vs Anticoagulation alone
- Significant PTS reduction (especially iliofemoral)
- Moderate/severe PTS: 18% vs 24%

## Complications

### Early

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Bleeding (minor) | 5-10% | Compression |
| Bleeding (major) | 2-5% | Transfusion, reversal |
| PE | <1% | IVC filter |
| Access site hematoma | 3-5% | Compression |

### Late

- Restenosis: Re-intervention
- Post-thrombotic syndrome: Reduced but possible

## Post-Procedure Management

### Anticoagulation

- Continue immediately
- Minimum 3-6 months
- If stented: Long-term

### Compression Stockings

- Below-knee 30-40 mmHg
- Recommended for 2 years
- PTS prevention

### Follow-up

- 1 week: Clinical check
- 1 month: Doppler US
- 6 months: Doppler US
- Annual: Assessment
