faq:
    - question: "What is May-Thurner syndrome?"
      answer: "It is the compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery against the spine. It causes DVT and leg swelling."
    - question: "How is May-Thurner syndrome diagnosed?"
      answer: "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is the most sensitive diagnostic method. MR/CT venography is also used."
    - question: "What is the treatment for May-Thurner syndrome?"
      answer: "Treatment involves placing a stent in the compressed iliac vein to restore vessel patency."
    - question: "Does May-Thurner syndrome cause DVT?"
      answer: "Yes, May-Thurner syndrome is the underlying cause in 50-60% of left leg DVTs."
    - question: "Is the stent permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, venous stents are permanent. However, stent patency is over 90% and usually remains problem-free for life."

May-Thurner syndrome treatment involves relieving compression of the left iliac vein through stenting.

## What is May-Thurner Syndrome?

May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS), also known as **iliac vein compression syndrome**, is the compression of the left common iliac vein between the right common iliac artery and the lumbar vertebra (L5).

**History:**
- 1851: Virchow first described it
- 1957: May and Thurner detailed anatomical study
- Modern era: Treatment with stenting

### Anatomy

```
Right Common Iliac Artery
        ↓
        X ← Compression point
        ↓
Left Common Iliac Vein
        ↓
      L5 Vertebra
```

**Pathophysiology:**
1. Mechanical compression
2. Chronic trauma → Intimal hyperplasia
3. "Spur" formation
4. Venous stasis and thrombosis risk

### Epidemiology

| Feature | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Female/Male | 2-3:1 |
| Age group | 20-50 years |
| MTS in left leg DVT | 50-60% |
| General population | 20-30% (anatomical) |

## May-Thurner Syndrome Symptoms

### Symptom Spectrum

**Asymptomatic:**
- Anatomical variant only
- Incidental finding

**Symptomatic:**
- Left leg swelling
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Acute DVT

### Clinical Findings

**Chronic Presentation:**
- Unilateral (left) leg swelling
- Pain and heaviness
- Varicose veins
- Leg fatigue
- Venous ulcer (advanced stage)

**Acute Presentation:**
- Sudden leg swelling
- Severe pain
- Iliofemoral DVT
- Phlegmasia (rare)

### Risk Factors

- Female gender
- Pregnancy/postpartum
- Prolonged immobilization
- Oral contraceptive use
- Pelvic surgery/trauma
- Hyperlordosis

## May-Thurner Syndrome Diagnosis

### Imaging Methods

**Doppler Ultrasonography:**
- First-line screening
- DVT detection
- Limited assessment at iliac level

**CT Venography:**
- Iliac compression imaging
- Anatomical assessment
- DVT extent

**MR Venography:**
- Non-invasive
- Soft tissue detail
- Contrast-free protocols possible

**Conventional Venography:**
- Reference standard
- "Smiley face" appearance (compression sign)
- Treatment planning

### Gold Standard: IVUS

**Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS):**
- Most sensitive diagnostic method
- Lumen area measurement
- >50% stenosis diagnostic criterion
- Stent sizing

**IVUS Advantages:**
- True stenosis degree
- Intimal spur detection
- Optimal stent placement
- Intra-procedural assessment

## Iliac Vein Stenting

### Indications

**Definite Indications:**
- Symptomatic MTS
- Chronic post-DVT obstruction
- Post-thrombotic syndrome

**Relative Indications:**
- Recurrent DVT
- Asymptomatic but >70% stenosis
- DVT prophylaxis

### Pre-procedure Preparation

- Planning with IVUS/Venography
- Anticoagulation assessment
- General condition evaluation

### Stenting Technique

**Access:**
- Femoral vein (retrograde)
- Popliteal vein (antegrade)
- Jugular vein (rarely)

**Procedure Steps:**

1. **Venous access** (US-guided)
2. **Diagnostic venography**
3. **IVUS assessment**
4. **Lesion crossing** (guidewire)
5. **Pre-dilation** (balloon angioplasty)
6. **Stent placement**
7. **Post-dilation**
8. **Control IVUS/venography**

### Stent Selection

| Stent Type | Feature | Use |
|------------|---------|-----|
| **Wallstent** | Woven, flexible | Classic choice |
| **Venivo** | Venous-specific | Modern choice |
| **ABRE** | Self-expanding | New generation |
| **Zilver Vena** | Nitinol | Iliofemoral |

**Stent Sizing:**
- Diameter: 10-20% larger than reference vein
- Length: Completely covering the lesion
- May extend to iliocaval junction

### Combined Approach in Acute DVT

**Pharmacomechanical Thrombectomy + Stenting:**

1. Thrombus clearance with CDT or PMT
2. Underlying MTS detection
3. Same-session stenting
4. Optimal outcome

## Treatment Outcomes

### Primary Stenting (Without DVT)

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical success | 98-100% |
| Symptom improvement | 85-95% |
| 1-year patency | 95-98% |
| 5-year patency | 85-90% |

### Post-thrombotic Stenting

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical success | 95-98% |
| Symptom improvement | 70-85% |
| 1-year patency | 80-90% |
| 5-year patency | 70-80% |

### Villalta Score Improvement

| Score | Before Treatment | After Treatment |
|-------|------------------|-----------------|
| Severe (>14) | 40% | 5% |
| Moderate (10-14) | 35% | 10% |
| Mild (5-9) | 20% | 25% |
| None (<5) | 5% | 60% |

## Post-Procedure Care

### Anticoagulation

**In Acute DVT:**
- At least 3-6 months anticoagulation
- Continuation decision based on risk factors

**In Primary Stenting:**
- Antiplatelet therapy (clopidogrel + aspirin)
- 3-6 months dual therapy
- Then aspirin monotherapy

### Follow-up Program

| Time | Assessment |
|------|------------|
| Week 1 | Clinical |
| Month 1 | Doppler US |
| Month 3 | Doppler US |
| Month 6 | Doppler US |
| Annually | Doppler US |

### Compression Therapy

- Below-knee compression stockings
- Class II (20-30 mmHg)
- Daytime use
- 2 years recommended duration

## Complications

### Intraprocedural

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Access site hematoma | 2-5% | Compression |
| Stent malposition | 1-2% | Repositioning |
| IVC protrusion | 1% | Partial acceptable |
| Vein perforation | <1% | Covered stent |

### Early Period

- Leg pain: Common, transient
- Superficial thrombophlebitis: Anticoagulation
- Early thrombosis: Thrombolysis/aspiration

### Late Period

- In-stent restenosis: 5-10%
- Stent fracture: Rare
- Stent migration: Very rare

## Special Situations

### May-Thurner in Pregnancy

- Pregnancy worsens MTS symptoms
- High DVT risk
- Anticoagulation (LMWH)
- Stenting usually postpartum

### Bilateral Iliac Compression

- Right iliac vein compression rare
- Cockett syndrome
- May require bilateral stenting

### Recurrent DVT

- Underlying MTS should be investigated
- Stenting prevents recurrence
- Long-term anticoagulation

## Prognosis

**If Untreated:**
- High recurrent DVT risk
- Post-thrombotic syndrome development
- Chronic venous insufficiency
- Poor quality of life

**If Treated:**
- Excellent symptom control
- Minimized DVT risk
- Normal quality of life
- Long-term stent patency
