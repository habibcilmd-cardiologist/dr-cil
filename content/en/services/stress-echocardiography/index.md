Stress echocardiography is an echocardiographic evaluation performed while the heart is under stress from exercise or medication. It has high accuracy in diagnosing coronary artery disease.

## What is Stress Echocardiography?

Stress echocardiography evaluates the presence of ischemia (insufficient blood flow) by comparing wall movements of the heart at rest and under stress.

**Advantages of Stress Echocardiography:**

-   No radiation
-   High diagnostic accuracy
-   Valve function evaluation
-   Real-time imaging

## Types of Stress Echocardiography

### Exercise Stress Echocardiography

-   With treadmill or bicycle
-   Physiological stress
-   Preferred method

### Pharmacological Stress Echocardiography

**Dobutamine:**

-   Increases heart rate and contractility
-   For patients who cannot exercise
-   Most commonly used medication

**Dipyridamole/Adenosine:**

-   Coronary vasodilator
-   Alternative option

## Stress Echocardiography Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

-   Suspected coronary artery disease
-   Chest pain evaluation
-   Abnormal ECG findings
-   Inconclusive stress test result

### Prognostic Evaluation

-   Known coronary artery disease
-   Post-myocardial infarction
-   Pre/post-revascularization
-   Pre-operative risk assessment

### Valve Diseases

-   Aortic stenosis severity
-   Mitral stenosis evaluation
-   Low-flow aortic stenosis

## Pre-Stress Echocardiography Preparation

### General Preparation

-   4 hours fasting
-   Caffeine restriction (24 hours)
-   Comfortable clothing

### Medication Adjustment

-   Beta blockers (stopped 48 hours before)
-   Calcium channel blockers
-   Nitrates

## How is Stress Echocardiography Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Resting imaging**: Baseline echocardiography
2. **Stress application**: Exercise or medication
3. **Peak stress imaging**: At maximum stress
4. **Recovery**: Monitoring and imaging
5. **Comparison**: Rest vs stress

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 45-60 minutes

## Stress Echocardiography Results

### Normal Findings

-   Normal wall motion in all segments
-   Increased motion with stress
-   No ischemia findings

### Abnormal Findings

| Finding                     | Meaning            |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Hypokinesis                 | Decreased motion   |
| Akinesis                    | No motion          |
| Dyskinesis                  | Paradoxical motion |
| New wall motion abnormality | Ischemia           |

## Stress Echocardiography Risks

Risks are low:

-   Chest pain
-   Arrhythmia
-   Blood pressure changes
-   Rarely serious complications

## Stress Echocardiography vs Other Tests

| Test                    | Advantage                      | Disadvantage       |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| Stress Echo             | No radiation, valve evaluation | Operator dependent |
| Myocardial Scintigraphy | Quantitative                   | Radiation          |
| Exercise Test           | Simple, inexpensive            | Lower accuracy     |
