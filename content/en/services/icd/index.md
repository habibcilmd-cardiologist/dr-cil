faq:
    - question: "Is an ICD shock painful?"
      answer: "An ICD shock gives a sudden, strong impact sensation. It can be uncomfortable but is life-saving. Most patients can tolerate the shock."
    - question: "Can I drive with an ICD?"
      answer: "If you haven't received a shock, you can usually drive. After a shock, driving restrictions apply for a certain period (usually 6 months)."
    - question: "How long does an ICD battery last?"
      answer: "ICD batteries typically last 5-10 years. When the battery runs out, only the generator is replaced."
    - question: "Can I have an MRI with an ICD?"
      answer: "MRI can be performed with new generation MRI-compatible ICDs. You should consult your doctor beforehand."
    - question: "What if the ICD doesn't deliver a shock?"
      answer: "The ICD continuously monitors the heart. If it doesn't detect a dangerous rhythm, it won't deliver a shock. This is normal operation."

An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is an advanced electronic device that detects and treats life-threatening heart rhythm disorders. ICD is the most effective treatment method for preventing sudden cardiac death. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in ICD implantation and uses the most current technologies to protect patients' lives.

## What is an ICD?

An ICD is a device that continuously monitors the heart's electrical activity and automatically delivers treatment when it detects dangerous rhythm disorders. In addition to pacemaker functions, it has the ability to deliver shocks.

**ICD Treatment Methods:**

1. **Antitachycardia pacing (ATP)**: Terminating tachycardia with rapid pacing
2. **Cardioversion**: Low-energy shock
3. **Defibrillation**: High-energy shock (in ventricular fibrillation)
4. **Bradycardia pacing**: Stimulation for slow heart rate

## Who Needs an ICD?

### Primary Prevention (No Event Yet)

-   Low ejection fraction (EF ≤35%)
-   Ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy
-   Low EF despite optimal medical therapy
-   Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (high risk)
-   Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy
-   Long QT syndrome
-   Brugada syndrome

### Secondary Prevention (Event Occurred)

-   After ventricular fibrillation
-   VT causing hemodynamic instability
-   Unexplained syncope + inducible VT

## Types of ICD

### Transvenous ICD

-   Traditional method
-   Electrodes placed in heart via blood vessels
-   Can be single or dual chamber
-   CRT-D (CRT with defibrillator) option

### Subcutaneous ICD (S-ICD)

-   Electrode placed under the skin
-   Does not enter blood vessels
-   Lower infection risk
-   Limited pacing function

## How is ICD Implantation Performed?

### Pre-Procedure Evaluation

-   Echocardiography
-   Electrophysiology study (in some cases)
-   Coronary angiography (if needed)
-   Blood tests
-   Anticoagulant adjustment

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia + sedation
2. **Pocket creation**: Under chest skin
3. **Electrode placement**: Under fluoroscopy guidance
4. **Defibrillation testing**: Verification that device works
5. **Generator connection**: Connecting electrodes to device
6. **Closure**: Skin closed with sutures

### Procedure Duration

ICD implantation usually takes 1-2 hours.

## ICD Shock

An ICD shock is the electrical treatment the device delivers when it detects a dangerous rhythm.

**Shock Sensation:**

-   Sudden, strong impact feeling
-   Lasts a few seconds
-   Usually effective and life-saving

**After Shock:**

-   Stay calm
-   Inform your doctor
-   Call emergency services if needed

**Inappropriate Shocks:**

-   Sometimes shocks may be delivered due to false detection
-   Can be minimized with programming
-   Report to your doctor

## Living with an ICD

You can lead a normal life with an ICD:

**What You Can Do:**

-   Daily activities
-   Light to moderate exercise
-   Travel
-   Sexual activity
-   Most jobs

**Things to Consider:**

-   Avoid strong magnetic fields
-   Driving restrictions (after shock)
-   Inform before certain medical procedures
-   Regular check-ups

## ICD Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Bleeding or hematoma
-   Infection
-   Pneumothorax
-   Electrode dislocation
-   Inappropriate shocks
-   Device malfunction (rare)
