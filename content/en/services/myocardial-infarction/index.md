    - question: "Can I return to normal life after a heart attack?"
      answer: "Yes, the vast majority of patients who receive timely and appropriate treatment can return to their normal lives. Participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program, regular medication use, and lifestyle changes are critical during this process."
    - question: "How long do I need to take blood thinners after stent placement?"
      answer: "While it varies depending on the type of stent and the patient's condition, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + a P2Y12 inhibitor) is generally required for at least 6-12 months. Aspirin continues for life."
    - question: "Can a heart attack recur?"
      answer: "Unfortunately, yes. However, the risk of recurrence can be significantly reduced through medication compliance, lifestyle changes, and regular check-ups. Controlling risk factors is vitally important in this regard."
    - question: "When can I resume sexual activity after a heart attack?"
      answer: "Generally, for uncomplicated recovery, sexual activity can be resumed once you can climb one flight of stairs (approximately 2-4 weeks). However, consulting with your doctor on this matter is highly recommended."
    - question: "What should I do in an emergency?"
      answer: "If experiencing heart attack symptoms: 1) Call emergency services immediately, 2) Chew aspirin if available, 3) Stay calm and sit or recline in a semi-upright position, 4) Loosen tight clothing. Never try to drive yourself to the hospital."

Your heart, one of the most vital organ in your body, beats approximately 100,000 times daily, pumping blood to every organ. When the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart become blocked, this essential organ is deprived of oxygen, and irreversible damage can occur. This condition is medically known as **myocardial infarction**, commonly called a **heart attack**.

## What is Myocardial Infarction?

Myocardial infarction occurs when the coronary arteries that nourish the heart muscle suddenly become blocked, causing heart tissue to suffer damage from lack of oxygen. This blockage typically happens when fatty deposits (atherosclerosis) within the vessel wall rupture, and a blood clot forms on top.

Every year, approximately 200,000 people in Turkey experience heart attacks, and a significant portion of these cases result in fatalities when not treated promptly. However, with the advanced treatment methods offered by modern cardiology, the vast majority of patients who receive timely care can return to their normal lives.

## Recognizing Heart Attack Symptoms

The most characteristic symptom of a heart attack is chest pain, though its characteristics can vary from person to person. Recognizing these potentially life-saving symptoms is extremely important:

### Typical Symptoms

-   **Chest pain or pressure**: A squeezing, crushing, or burning pain starting in the center or left side of the chest. This pain typically lasts more than 15-20 minutes and doesn't subside with rest.

-   **Radiating pain**: Pain that spreads from the chest to the left arm, shoulder, jaw, back, or stomach area.

-   **Shortness of breath**: Difficulty breathing that accompanies chest pain or occurs on its own.

-   **Sweating**: Cold, clammy perspiration, especially when combined with chest pain.

-   **Nausea and vomiting**: Stomach discomfort, particularly common in women.

### Atypical Symptoms

Heart attacks can present with atypical symptoms, especially in women, diabetic patients, and the elderly:

-   Extreme fatigue and weakness
-   Dizziness or feeling faint
-   Palpitations or irregular heartbeats
-   Back or stomach pain alone
-   Flu-like symptoms

**Important Warning**: If you experience any of these symptoms, call emergency services immediately or go to the nearest emergency room. Every minute counts during a heart attack.

## Diagnostic Methods

For patients who arrive at the emergency department with suspected heart attack, rapid and accurate diagnosis is life-saving. Our experienced cardiology team performs the following tests in our state-of-the-art equipped units:

### Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG)

The ECG is the first and most important diagnostic tool for heart attacks. This test records the heart's electrical activity and provides results within minutes, showing which area has been damaged. ST segment elevation (STEMI) or changes allow us to determine the type of heart attack.

### Cardiac Biomarkers (Blood Tests)

When heart muscle is damaged, certain enzymes are released into the blood. The most important of these enzymes include:

-   **Troponin I and T**: The most sensitive markers specific to heart muscle
-   **CK-MB**: An enzyme indicating heart muscle damage
-   **Myoglobin**: A muscle protein that rises early in the process

### Echocardiography

This ultrasound imaging of the heart allows us to evaluate heart muscle movement, pumping strength, and damaged areas.

### Coronary Angiography

Coronary angiography, the gold standard diagnostic method, enables direct visualization of blocked or narrowed vessels. This procedure also allows for treatment (angioplasty and stenting).

## Our Treatment Approaches

In myocardial infarction treatment, the principle "time is muscle" applies. Every passing minute leads to more heart muscle loss. Therefore, starting treatment as quickly as possible is vitally important.

### Emergency Medical Treatment

Our treatment protocol begins the moment you arrive at the hospital and includes:

-   Aspirin and other blood thinners
-   Pain control medications
-   Oxygen support
-   Nitroglycerin (vasodilator)
-   Beta-blockers
-   Anticoagulant therapy

### Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (Primary PCI)

This is the preferred standard treatment method for STEMI-type heart attacks today. During this procedure:

1. A thin catheter is inserted through the groin or wrist
2. The blocked vessel is accessed
3. The blockage is opened with balloon angioplasty
4. A stent is placed to keep the vessel open

Our clinic offers 24/7 primary PCI service. Our experienced team maintains "door-to-balloon" times below international standards, ensuring the fastest possible intervention for patients.

### Thrombolytic Therapy

When PCI is not available or if transport time would be prolonged, clot-dissolving medications (thrombolytics) may be used. However, the effectiveness of this treatment is time-dependent, and it is contraindicated in some patients.

### Coronary Bypass Surgery

Some patients with multi-vessel disease or left main coronary artery blockage may require surgical treatment. This decision is made by our heart team using a multidisciplinary approach.

## Recovery Process and Rehabilitation

The recovery process after a heart attack varies depending on the patient's overall condition and the extent of heart damage. However, with proper rehabilitation programs, the vast majority of patients can return to active lives.

### Hospital Stay

-   2-5 days for uncomplicated cases
-   Comprehensive evaluation and medication adjustment
-   Early mobilization
-   Patient and family education

### Cardiac Rehabilitation

One of the most important steps after a heart attack is cardiac rehabilitation. Our program includes:

-   **Physical exercise program**: Personalized, gradually increasing exercise protocol
-   **Nutritional counseling**: Diet planning that supports heart health
-   **Stress management**: Psychological support and stress reduction techniques
-   **Risk factor control**: Smoking cessation, weight control, diabetes and blood pressure management

## Risk Factors and Prevention

Some factors that increase heart attack risk can be modified, while others cannot. Controlling modifiable factors can significantly reduce the risk of heart attack.

### Modifiable Risk Factors

| Risk Factor         | Recommended Target                 |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Smoking             | Complete cessation                 |
| High blood pressure | <130/80 mmHg                       |
| High cholesterol    | LDL <70 mg/dL (high-risk patients) |
| Diabetes            | HbA1c <7%                          |
| Obesity             | BMI 18.5-24.9                      |
| Sedentary lifestyle | 150 min moderate exercise per week |

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

-   Age (>45 in men, >55 in women)
-   Gender (Higher risk in men)
-   Family history (Early heart disease in first-degree relatives)
