faq:
    - question: "Is stent permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, metal stents are permanent. Bioresorbable stents dissolve over time."
    - question: "How long does medication use last after stent?"
      answer: "Dual antiplatelet therapy usually lasts 6-12 months. Aspirin continues for life."
    - question: "Can I have MRI after stent?"
      answer: "Yes, modern stents are MRI compatible."
    - question: "Can I exercise after stent?"
      answer: "Yes, regular exercise is recommended after recovery."
    - question: "Can stent get blocked?"
      answer: "Rarely. Medication compliance and lifestyle changes are important."

Cardiac stent is a metal mesh structure placed to keep coronary artery stenosis open. It is widely used in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in cardiac stent implantation.

## What is Cardiac Stent?

Cardiac stent is a cylindrical metal mesh that keeps the vessel open after balloon angioplasty. It adheres to the vessel wall and prevents recurrence of stenosis.

**Types of Stents:**

-   Bare metal stent (BMS)
-   Drug-eluting stent (DES)
-   Bioresorbable stent

## Cardiac Stent Indications

### Acute Coronary Syndrome

-   ST-elevation myocardial infarction
-   Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
-   Unstable angina

### Stable Coronary Artery Disease

-   Severe stenosis (>70%)
-   Symptomatic patients
-   Positive stress test
-   Unresponsive to medical therapy

## Types of Stents

### Bare Metal Stent (BMS)

-   First generation stents
-   Higher restenosis rate
-   Short-term antiplatelet therapy

### Drug-Eluting Stent (DES)

-   Antiproliferative drug coated
-   Low restenosis rate
-   Long-term antiplatelet therapy
-   Current standard

### Bioresorbable Stent

-   Dissolving structure over time
-   Vessel function preserved
-   In selected patients

## How is Stent Implantation Performed?

### Preparation

-   Evaluation with angiography
-   Antiplatelet loading
-   Hydration

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Femoral or radial
2. **Guide catheter**: To coronary ostium
3. **Guidewire**: Crossing lesion
4. **Predilation**: With balloon
5. **Stent placement**: Over lesion
6. **Stent deployment**: Balloon inflation
7. **Postdilation**: If needed
8. **Control angiography**: Result evaluation

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 30-90 minutes

## Post-Stent Treatment

### Antiplatelet Therapy

**Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT):**

-   Aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor
-   Duration: 6-12 months (DES)
-   Duration: 1-3 months (BMS)

### Other Medications

-   Statin
-   Beta blocker
-   ACE inhibitor
-   Nitrate (if needed)

## Stent Complications

### Early Complications

-   Stent thrombosis
-   Dissection
-   Perforation

### Late Complications

-   In-stent restenosis
-   Late stent thrombosis
-   Neoatherosclerosis
