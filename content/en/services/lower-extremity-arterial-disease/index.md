    - question: "Why does leg pain occur while walking?"
      answer: "Due to narrowing of leg arteries, muscles cannot receive adequate blood and pain occurs."
    - question: "Can peripheral artery disease be treated?"
      answer: "Yes, it can be treated with medical therapy, endovascular intervention, or surgery."
    - question: "Does walking distance increase after stenting?"
      answer: "Yes, walking distance significantly increases after successful treatment."
    - question: "What is critical limb ischemia?"
      answer: "It is advanced stage disease characterized by rest pain, wound, or gangrene."
    - question: "Should smoking be stopped?"
      answer: "Yes, smoking is the most important cause of the disease and affects treatment success."

Lower extremity arterial disease (LEAD) is narrowing of leg arteries due to atherosclerosis. It can cause walking pain and gangrene in advanced stages. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating lower extremity arterial disease.

## What is Lower Extremity Arterial Disease?

Lower extremity arterial disease is narrowing of leg arteries due to atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Blood flow decreases and leg muscles cannot receive adequate oxygen.

**Affected Arteries:**

-   Aortoiliac segment
-   Femoral arteries
-   Popliteal artery
-   Tibial arteries

## Causes of Lower Extremity Arterial Disease

### Risk Factors

-   Smoking (most important)
-   Diabetes
-   Hypertension
-   Hyperlipidemia
-   Advanced age

### Other Factors

-   Family history
-   Obesity
-   Sedentary lifestyle
-   Chronic kidney disease

## Lower Extremity Arterial Disease Symptoms

### Claudication (Intermittent Limping)

-   Leg pain while walking
-   Resolves with rest
-   Starts at certain distance
-   Most common calf pain

### Critical Limb Ischemia

-   Rest pain
-   Foot wound
-   Gangrene
-   Amputation risk

### Fontaine Classification

| Stage | Findings                             |
| ----- | ------------------------------------ |
| I     | Asymptomatic                         |
| IIa   | Mild claudication (>200m)            |
| IIb   | Moderate-severe claudication (<200m) |
| III   | Rest pain                            |
| IV    | Ulcer/Gangrene                       |

## Lower Extremity Arterial Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Pulse examination
-   Ankle-brachial index (ABI)
-   Capillary refill time

### Imaging

-   Doppler ultrasonography
-   CT Angiography
-   MR Angiography
-   Conventional angiography

### ABI Evaluation

| ABI     | Interpretation     |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| >1.3    | Calcified arteries |
| 0.9-1.3 | Normal             |
| 0.7-0.9 | Mild disease       |
| 0.4-0.7 | Moderate disease   |
| <0.4    | Severe disease     |

## Lower Extremity Arterial Disease Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Smoking cessation
-   Exercise program
-   Antiplatelet therapy
-   Statin therapy
-   Diabetes control

### Endovascular Treatment

**Balloon Angioplasty:**

-   In short segment stenosis
-   In femoral and popliteal arteries

**Stent:**

-   In iliac arteries
-   In long segment lesions
-   In case of dissection

**Drug-Coated Balloon/Stent:**

-   Reduces restenosis risk
-   Preferred in femoral arteries

### Surgical Treatment

-   Bypass surgery
-   Endarterectomy
-   Hybrid procedures
