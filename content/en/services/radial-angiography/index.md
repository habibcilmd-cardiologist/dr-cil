    - question: "Is radial angiography painful?"
      answer: "Since local anesthesia is applied, no pain is felt during the procedure."
    - question: "When can I go home after radial angiography?"
      answer: "Most patients can be discharged the same day."
    - question: "Can I use my wrist after radial angiography?"
      answer: "Yes, you can return to normal activities after 24 hours."
    - question: "Is radial access possible in every patient?"
      answer: "It is possible in most patients. Femoral access is preferred if Allen test is negative or there are anatomical issues."
    - question: "Is radial angiography safer than femoral angiography?"
      answer: "Yes, bleeding and complication risk is lower."

Radial angiography is coronary angiography performed through the wrist (radial artery). It has many advantages over traditional groin (femoral) access.

## What is Radial Angiography?

Radial angiography is the use of the radial artery on the inner side of the wrist for imaging heart vessels. It is the preferred access route in modern cardiology.

**Advantages of Radial Access:**

-   Lower bleeding risk
-   Early mobilization
-   Shorter hospital stay
-   Better patient comfort

## Radial vs Femoral Access

| Feature         | Radial    | Femoral          |
| --------------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Bleeding risk   | Low       | High             |
| Mobilization    | Immediate | 4-6 hours        |
| Patient comfort | High      | Low              |
| Complications   | Less      | More             |
| Discharge       | Same day  | Usually next day |

## Radial Angiography Indications

### Diagnostic Angiography

-   Suspected coronary artery disease
-   Chest pain evaluation
-   Acute coronary syndrome
-   Pre-valve surgery

### Interventional Procedures

-   Coronary angioplasty
-   Stent implantation
-   CTO interventions
-   Complex PCI

## Pre-Radial Angiography Preparation

### Allen Test

Hand circulation is evaluated before using radial artery:

-   Ulnar artery adequacy is checked
-   Femoral access is preferred if test is negative

### Patient Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Wrist area shaving
-   Medication adjustment
-   Hydration

## How is Radial Angiography Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: To wrist area
2. **Artery puncture**: Radial artery
3. **Sheath placement**: 5-6 French
4. **Spasmolytic**: To prevent vessel spasm
5. **Catheter advancement**: Under fluoroscopy
6. **Imaging**: Coronary arteries
7. **Hemostasis**: TR Band or manual compression

### Procedure Duration

Diagnostic angiography: 15-30 minutes

## Post-Radial Angiography Care

### Hemostasis

-   TR Band (transparent compression band)
-   2-4 hours compression
-   Gradual loosening

### Mobilization

-   Can sit immediately
-   Can walk after 2-4 hours
-   Same-day discharge possible

### Precautions

-   Keep wrist elevated
-   No heavy lifting (24 hours)
-   Bleeding control

## Radial Angiography Complications

Complications are rare:

-   Radial artery spasm
-   Radial artery occlusion
-   Hematoma
-   Nerve damage (very rare)
