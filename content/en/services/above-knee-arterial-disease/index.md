    - question: "What is above-knee arterial occlusion?"
      answer: "It is the narrowing or blockage of the femoral and popliteal arteries (thigh and behind-knee vessels) due to atherosclerosis. It can severely reduce blood flow to the leg."
    - question: "What are the symptoms of above-knee arterial occlusion?"
      answer: "Calf and thigh pain while walking (claudication), coldness in the leg, numbness, and in advanced cases, rest pain are observed."
    - question: "How is femoropopliteal artery occlusion treated?"
      answer: "It can be treated with balloon angioplasty, drug-coated balloon, stent, or atherectomy. Treatment choice is determined based on lesion characteristics."
    - question: "What is the success rate of above-knee stenting?"
      answer: "Technical success is over 95% in experienced centers. One-year patency rates range from 70-85%."
    - question: "When can I walk after treatment?"
      answer: "Most patients can walk the same day or the next day after the procedure. Walking distance typically increases significantly."

Above-knee arterial occlusion is the narrowing or blockage of the femoropopliteal artery segment due to atherosclerosis. This area is the most common location for peripheral artery disease. Cardiology specialist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in interventional treatment of above-knee vascular diseases.

## Femoropopliteal Artery Anatomy

The femoropopliteal segment is the longest artery segment of the leg and is subject to the most mechanical stress.

**Anatomical Structure:**

```

Common Femoral Artery
        ↓
     ┌──┴──┐
     ↓     ↓
  Deep      Superficial
 Femoral    Femoral Artery
(Profunda)      (SFA)
                 ↓
           Popliteal Artery
                 ↓
          ┌──────┼──────┐
          ↓      ↓      ↓
       Anterior Tibio-  Posterior
       Tibial  peroneal  Tibial
```

**Segment Lengths:**

- Superficial femoral artery (SFA): ~30-40 cm
- Popliteal artery: ~15-20 cm
- Total femoropopliteal segment: ~50 cm

## Why Is the Femoropopliteal Region Most Affected?

### Mechanical Factors

1. **Adductor canal:** The narrowest passage point for SFA
2. **Flexion stress:** Repeated trauma during knee bending
3. **Long segment:** Large surface area for atherosclerosis

### Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Smoking | Most important risk factor |
| Diabetes | Diffuse disease pattern |
| Hypertension | Endothelial damage |
| Hyperlipidemia | Plaque formation |
| Age >50 | Progressive process |

## Symptoms of Above-Knee Arterial Occlusion

### Fontaine Classification

| Stage | Findings |
|-------|----------|
| **Stage I** | Asymptomatic |
| **Stage IIa** | Claudication >200 m |
| **Stage IIb** | Claudication <200 m |
| **Stage III** | Rest pain |
| **Stage IV** | Ulcer/Gangrene |

### Typical Symptoms

**Claudication (Intermittent Limping):**

- Calf or thigh pain while walking
- Improves in 2-5 minutes with rest
- Starts at a certain distance
- Earlier on slopes/stairs

**Advanced Stage Symptoms:**

- Night pain (decreases when leg is lowered)
- Cold feet
- Trophic changes (hair loss, nail thickening)
- Non-healing wounds

## Diagnostic Methods

### Physical Examination

- Femoral and popliteal pulse palpation
- ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) measurement
- Capillary refill time

**ABI Assessment:**

| ABI Value | Interpretation |
|-----------|----------------|
| 0.91-1.30 | Normal |
| 0.71-0.90 | Mild PAD |
| 0.41-0.70 | Moderate PAD |
| ≤0.40 | Severe PAD/Critical ischemia |

### Imaging

**Doppler Ultrasound:**
- First-line test
- Non-invasive
- Flow velocities and stenosis degree

**CT Angiography:**
- Detailed anatomical map
- Calcification assessment
- Treatment planning

**DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography):**
- Gold standard
- Treatment possible in same session

## TASC II Classification (Femoropopliteal)

| TASC | Lesion Type | Treatment |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **A** | Single stenosis ≤10 cm, single occlusion ≤5 cm | Endovascular |
| **B** | Multiple stenoses, single occlusion ≤15 cm | Endovascular |
| **C** | Multiple stenoses/occlusions >15 cm | Endovascular/Surgical |
| **D** | Chronic total occlusion (entire CFA or SFA) | Surgical (primarily) |

## Endovascular Treatment Options

### 1. Balloon Angioplasty (PTA)

**Conventional Balloon:**
- For short lesions
- Low cost
- Restenosis risk: 40-60% (1 year)

**Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB):**
- Paclitaxel or Sirolimus coated
- Prevents neointimal hyperplasia
- Restenosis risk: 15-25% (1 year)
- Preferred method

### 2. Stenting

**Self-Expanding Nitinol Stent:**
- Long segment disease
- Flexibility advantage
- 1-year patency: 70-80%

**Drug-Eluting Stent (DES):**
- Best long-term results
- Low restenosis risk
- High cost

**Interwoven Stent:**
- New generation technology
- High fracture resistance
- Suitable for knee area

### 3. Atherectomy

**Plaque removal techniques:**

| Type | Mechanism | Indication |
|------|-----------|------------|
| Rotational | Plaque fragmentation | Calcified lesion |
| Directional | Plaque cutting | Eccentric plaque |
| Orbital | Orbital grinding | Heavy calcification |
| Laser | Photo-ablation | In-stent restenosis |

### 4. Chronic Total Occlusion (CTO) Crossing

**Techniques:**
- Antegrade approach (ipsilateral)
- Retrograde approach (from tibial arteries)
- Subintimal angioplasty (SAFARI technique)

**Success rate:** 80-95% (in experienced centers)

## Treatment Outcomes

### Primary Patency Rates

| Treatment Method | 1 Year | 2 Years |
|------------------|--------|---------|
| Balloon angioplasty | 50-60% | 40-50% |
| Drug-coated balloon | 75-85% | 65-75% |
| Bare stent | 65-75% | 55-65% |
| Drug-eluting stent | 80-90% | 70-80% |

### Clinical Improvement

- Claudication distance: 2-4x increase
- Quality of life: Significant improvement
- Limb salvage: >95%

## Complications and Management

### Early Complications

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Dissection | 5-10% | Stenting |
| Perforation | <1% | Long balloon/Covered stent |
| Distal embolism | 1-2% | Aspiration/Thrombolysis |
| Access site complication | 3-5% | Compression |

### Late Complications

- **Restenosis:** Most common problem, reduced with DCB/DES
- **Stent fracture:** Especially in knee area
- **Thrombosis:** With antiplatelet non-compliance

## Medical Treatment

### For All Patients

- **Aspirin:** 100 mg/day (lifelong)
- **Clopidogrel:** 75 mg/day (at least 6 months)
- **Statin:** LDL <70 mg/dL target
- **ACE inhibitor:** Vascular protection
- **Smoking cessation:** Mandatory

### Exercise Program

- Supervised walking program
- 3 days per week, 30-45 minutes
- Walking to claudication threshold
- Significant benefit in 3-6 months

## Surgical Treatment

### Indications

- TASC D lesions
- Failed endovascular intervention
- Young, active patients (for long-term patency)

### Surgical Options

- **Femoral-popliteal bypass:** Saphenous vein or synthetic graft
- **Femoral endarterectomy:** Localized disease
- **Hybrid procedure:** Iliac stent + Femoral bypass

## Follow-up Protocol

### Regular Checks

| Period | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| 1 month | Clinical + ABI |
| 3 months | Doppler US |
| 6 months | Doppler US + ABI |
| 12 months | Clinical + Doppler US |
| Afterwards | Every 6 months |

### Warning Signs

- Decrease in walking distance
- New onset rest pain
- Coldness/color change in foot
