    - question: "Is balloon valvuloplasty painful?"
      answer: "No pain is felt as it is performed under local or general anesthesia."
    - question: "How long is recovery after balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Usually 1-2 days hospital stay is sufficient. Normal activities can be resumed within 1 week."
    - question: "Is balloon valvuloplasty permanent?"
      answer: "It provides long-term effect in mitral stenosis. It is temporary in aortic stenosis."
    - question: "What are the risks of balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Severe mitral regurgitation, tamponade, and embolism are rare complications."
    - question: "Am I suitable for balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Decision is made by evaluating valve anatomy and accompanying conditions."

Balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure to dilate a narrowed heart valve using a balloon catheter. It is an effective treatment method especially for mitral and pulmonary valve stenosis. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in balloon valvuloplasty procedures.

## What is Balloon Valvuloplasty?

Balloon valvuloplasty is the opening of a narrowed valve by inflating a balloon at the catheter tip. It is a minimally invasive alternative to open heart surgery.

**Types of Balloon Valvuloplasty:**

-   Mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV)
-   Pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty
-   Aortic balloon valvuloplasty
-   Tricuspid balloon valvuloplasty

## Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty (PMBV)

### Indications

-   Symptomatic mitral stenosis
-   Suitable valve anatomy
-   No severe mitral regurgitation
-   No left atrial thrombus

### Wilkins Score

Used to evaluate valve suitability:

| Parameter     | 1       | 2        | 3        | 4        |
| ------------- | ------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Mobility      | High    | Moderate | Low      | Very low |
| Thickening    | Minimal | Moderate | Marked   | Severe   |
| Calcification | None    | Mild     | Moderate | Severe   |
| Subvalvular   | Normal  | Mild     | Moderate | Severe   |

Total score ≤8: Good candidate

### Procedure Technique

1. Femoral vein access
2. Transseptal puncture
3. Advancing balloon catheter to left atrium
4. Crossing mitral valve
5. Balloon inflation
6. Result evaluation

## Pulmonary Balloon Valvuloplasty

### Indications

-   Congenital pulmonary stenosis
-   Gradient >40 mmHg
-   Symptomatic patients

### Technique

-   Femoral vein access
-   Via right ventricle
-   Balloon inflation at pulmonary valve

## Aortic Balloon Valvuloplasty

### Indications

-   Bridge therapy before TAVI
-   Hemodynamic instability
-   Patients unsuitable for surgery

### Limitations

-   Temporary effect
-   High restenosis risk
-   Palliative treatment

## Pre-Balloon Valvuloplasty Preparation

### Evaluation

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Transesophageal echocardiography
-   Left atrial thrombus screening
-   Mitral regurgitation assessment

### Patient Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Anticoagulation adjustment
-   Laboratory tests
-   Anesthesia evaluation

## How is Balloon Valvuloplasty Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local or general
2. **Vascular access**: Femoral vein
3. **Transseptal puncture**: Access to left atrium
4. **Balloon placement**: At valve level
5. **Balloon inflation**: Gradual
6. **Result check**: Gradient measurement
7. **Hemostasis**: Access site closure

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 1-2 hours

## Balloon Valvuloplasty Results

### Success Criteria

-   Valve area increase
-   Gradient decrease
-   Symptom improvement
-   No serious complications

### Complications

-   Severe mitral regurgitation
-   Cardiac tamponade
-   Embolism
-   Vascular complications
