faq:
    - question: "What is a bifurcation lesion?"
      answer: "A bifurcation lesion is a narrowing or blockage at the point where a coronary artery divides into main and side branches."
    - question: "Is bifurcation intervention dangerous?"
      answer: "It is safe in experienced hands. As a complex procedure, it should be performed by an expert interventional cardiologist."
    - question: "What are bifurcation stenting techniques?"
      answer: "Provisional stenting, Culotte, Crush, T-stent, and TAP techniques are used. Selection depends on lesion anatomy."
    - question: "What is recovery like after bifurcation intervention?"
      answer: "Usually 1-2 days hospital stay is sufficient. Blood thinning medications must be taken regularly."
    - question: "What is the success rate of bifurcation intervention?"
      answer: "Experienced centers achieve over 95% procedural success. Long-term outcomes are also favorable."

Bifurcation interventions involve advanced percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) techniques used to treat complex lesions at coronary artery branching points.

## What is a Bifurcation Lesion?

A bifurcation is the area where a coronary artery divides into a main vessel (main branch) and a side branch. Atherosclerotic plaques frequently develop in these areas and require specialized techniques for treatment.

**Bifurcation Anatomy:**

- **Main vessel:** Proximal and distal segments
- **Side branch:** Branch separating from main vessel
- **Carina:** The ridge structure at the branching point

## Bifurcation Classification

### Medina Classification

Bifurcation lesions are evaluated according to the Medina classification:

| Medina Type | Proximal | Distal | Side Branch |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| 1,1,1       | Involved | Involved | Involved  |
| 1,1,0       | Involved | Involved | Free      |
| 1,0,1       | Involved | Free     | Involved  |
| 0,1,1       | Free     | Involved | Involved  |
| 1,0,0       | Involved | Free     | Free      |
| 0,1,0       | Free     | Involved | Free      |
| 0,0,1       | Free     | Free     | Involved  |

### True vs Non-True Bifurcation

- **True bifurcation:** Both main vessel and side branch involved (Medina 1,1,1 / 1,0,1 / 0,1,1)
- **Non-true bifurcation:** Only main vessel or only side branch involved

## Bifurcation Intervention Techniques

### 1. Provisional Stenting (Preferred)

The most commonly used and recommended technique:

- Stent placed in main vessel
- Side branch dilated with balloon if needed
- Side branch stent applied only when necessary

**Advantages:**
- Less stent usage
- Lower complication risk
- Better long-term outcomes

### 2. Two-Stent Techniques

May be required for true bifurcation lesions:

**Culotte Technique:**
- Stent placed in both branches
- Stents pass through each other
- Provides complete carina coverage

**Crush Technique:**
- Side branch stent crushed by main vessel stent
- DK-Crush modification provides better results

**T-Stent and TAP Technique:**
- Suitable for 90-degree angle bifurcations
- T-stent with protrusion (TAP) modification

**V-Stent (Kissing Stent):**
- Both stents join proximally
- Rarely preferred

## Imaging in Bifurcation Intervention

### IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound)

- Lesion characterization
- Stent placement control
- Optimal expansion assessment

### OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography)

- High-resolution imaging
- Stent strut coverage assessment
- Plaque structure analysis

## Procedure Steps

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

- Dual antiplatelet therapy (Aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)
- Lesion assessment with coronary angiography
- IVUS/OCT planning

### Procedural Steps

1. **Arterial access:** Radial or femoral artery
2. **Wire crossing:** Wire placement in both branches
3. **Predilation:** Balloon pre-dilation
4. **Stent deployment:** According to selected technique
5. **POT (Proximal Optimization Technique):** Proximal optimization
6. **Kissing balloon:** Final kissing inflation
7. **Imaging:** Result control with IVUS/OCT

### Post-Procedure Care

- 6-12 months dual antiplatelet therapy
- Regular cardiology follow-ups
- Risk factor management

## Bifurcation Intervention Complications

### Possible Complications

- Side branch loss
- Stent thrombosis
- Restenosis
- Vessel dissection
- Perforation (rare)

### Risk Reduction Strategies

- Experienced operator
- IVUS/OCT utilization
- Appropriate technique selection
- Optimal stent expansion

## Bifurcation Intervention Outcomes

### Success Rates

- Procedural success: >95%
- Side branch patency: >90%
- 1-year MACE (major adverse cardiac events): <10%

### Long-Term Follow-Up

- Regular clinical monitoring
- Stress testing or imaging
- Medication compliance tracking
