    - question: "Is left main coronary disease dangerous?"
      answer: "Yes, left main coronary disease is a high-risk condition because it supplies a large portion of the heart. However, excellent results can be achieved with appropriate treatment."
    - question: "Is stenting as effective as bypass?"
      answer: "In appropriate patients (low-intermediate SYNTAX score), stenting gives similar results to bypass. Patient selection is critically important."
    - question: "How long should I take medication after left main stent?"
      answer: "Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) should be used for at least 12 months, longer in some patients."
    - question: "Is control angiography necessary after stenting?"
      answer: "After left main stenting, control angiography is usually recommended within 3-6 months. Evaluation is done with IVUS/OCT."
    - question: "Does the left main stent last a lifetime?"
      answer: "Yes, the stent is permanent. With regular follow-up and medication use, it remains trouble-free for many years."

The left main coronary artery (LMCA) is the main vessel that supplies the left side of the heart and feeds approximately 75% of the heart muscle. Disease in this critical vessel can be treated with bypass surgery or stenting. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in left main coronary stenting and offers minimally invasive treatment in appropriate patients.

## What is the Left Main Coronary Artery?

The left main coronary artery (LMCA) is a critical vessel that emerges from the aorta and divides into two main branches after a short distance:

1. **Left Anterior Descending Artery (LAD)**: Supplies the front wall of the heart
2. **Circumflex Artery (Cx)**: Supplies the side and back wall of the heart

LMCA disease is seen in approximately 5-7% of patients undergoing coronary angiography and is a high-risk condition.

## Importance of Left Main Coronary Disease

Why is LMCA disease critical?

-   Supplies a large portion of the heart muscle
-   High risk of sudden cardiac death
-   Poor prognosis if untreated
-   May require emergency intervention

## Symptoms

Symptoms of left main coronary disease:

-   Severe chest pain (angina)
-   Shortness of breath increasing with exertion
-   Easy fatigue
-   Palpitations
-   Sudden loss of consciousness (syncope)

⚠️ **Warning**: Emergency intervention is required in unstable angina or acute coronary syndrome!

## Diagnosis

### Coronary Angiography

Gold standard in diagnosis of left main coronary disease:

-   Degree of stenosis (50% and above is significant)
-   Lesion location (ostial, shaft, bifurcation)
-   Distal vessel quality

### Intravascular Imaging

**IVUS (Intravascular Ultrasound):**

-   Lesion characterization
-   Minimal lumen area measurement
-   Stent optimization

**OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography):**

-   High-resolution imaging
-   Plaque structure analysis

### Functional Assessment

**FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve):**

-   Determines functional significance of stenosis
-   FFR ≤0.80 indicates significant stenosis

## Treatment Options

### Bypass Surgery (CABG)

Traditionally the standard treatment for left main coronary disease:

**Advantages:**

-   Long-term results proven
-   Preferred in complex anatomy
-   Complete revascularization

**Disadvantages:**

-   Open heart surgery
-   Long recovery time
-   Surgical risks

### Left Main Coronary Stenting (PCI)

Minimally invasive treatment with modern stent technology:

**Suitable Patients:**

-   Low-intermediate SYNTAX score (<33)
-   Isolated LMCA disease
-   High surgical risk patients
-   Patient preference

**Technical Features:**

-   Drug-eluting stents (DES)
-   IVUS/OCT guidance
-   Bifurcation techniques
-   Optimal stent expansion

## Left Main Coronary Stenting Techniques

### Ostial and Shaft Lesions

Relatively simple technique:

-   Single stent placement
-   Optimization with IVUS
-   High-pressure balloon expansion

### Bifurcation Lesions

Requires more complex techniques:

**Provisional Stenting:**

-   Stent to main vessel
-   Balloon/stent to side branch if needed
-   Most commonly preferred technique

**Two-Stent Techniques:**

-   Culotte technique
-   DK-Crush technique
-   T-stenting
-   TAP (T and Protrusion)

### Intravascular Imaging Guidance

IVUS/OCT use is critical in left main stenting:

-   Lesion assessment
-   Stent sizing
-   Stent expansion control
-   Complication detection

## Stenting or Bypass?

The decision is made individually:

| Factor          | Stenting Preferred | Bypass Preferred    |
| --------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| SYNTAX score    | <33                | ≥33                 |
| Lesion          | Isolated/simple    | Complex/multivessel |
| Diabetes        | No                 | Yes                 |
| Surgical risk   | High               | Low                 |
| Life expectancy | Short              | Long                |

## Left Main Stenting Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Death (1-2%)
-   Myocardial infarction (2-3%)
-   Need for emergency bypass (<1%)
-   Stent thrombosis (rare)
-   Restenosis (5-10%)

## Post-Procedure Care

After left main stenting:

**In Hospital:**

-   Intensive care monitoring
-   ECG and enzyme monitoring
-   Access site control

**After Discharge:**

-   Dual antiplatelet therapy (at least 12 months)
-   High-dose statin
-   Risk factor control
-   Regular angiographic follow-up
