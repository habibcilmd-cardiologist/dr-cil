    - question: "Is echocardiography painful?"
      answer: "No, transthoracic echocardiography is a completely painless procedure. Only gel is applied to the chest and imaging is done with a probe."
    - question: "How long does echocardiography take?"
      answer: "Standard transthoracic echocardiography takes 20-45 minutes."
    - question: "Do I need to fast for echocardiography?"
      answer: "Fasting is not required for transthoracic echo. 6 hours fasting is required for transesophageal echo."
    - question: "Is echocardiography harmful?"
      answer: "No, since ultrasound waves are used, it contains no radiation and is completely safe."
    - question: "When do echocardiography results come out?"
      answer: "Results are usually evaluated and reported on the same day."

Echocardiography is a non-invasive imaging method that evaluates the structure and function of the heart using ultrasound waves. It is one of the most valuable diagnostic tools in cardiology. Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in echocardiography interpretation.

## What is Echocardiography?

Echocardiography uses sound waves to create real-time moving images of the heart. This allows detailed examination of heart chambers, valves, walls, and great vessels.

**Structures Evaluated by Echocardiography:**

-   Heart chambers (atria and ventricles)
-   Heart valves
-   Heart walls
-   Pericardium (heart membrane)
-   Great vessels (aorta, pulmonary artery)

## Types of Echocardiography

### Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)

-   Most commonly used method
-   Performed through chest wall
-   Painless and non-invasive
-   Takes 20-45 minutes

### Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)

-   Performed through esophagus
-   More detailed imaging
-   Valve diseases and thrombus detection
-   Requires sedation

### Stress Echocardiography

-   Under stress with exercise or medication
-   Ischemia evaluation
-   Coronary artery disease diagnosis

### 3D Echocardiography

-   Three-dimensional imaging
-   Valve anatomy evaluation
-   Surgical planning

## Echocardiography Indications

### Symptom Evaluation

-   Shortness of breath
-   Chest pain
-   Palpitations
-   Leg swelling
-   Fainting

### Disease Diagnosis and Follow-up

-   Heart failure
-   Valve diseases
-   Cardiomyopathy
-   Congenital heart diseases
-   Pericarditis
-   Suspected endocarditis

### Other Indications

-   Post-heart attack evaluation
-   Pre-operative assessment
-   Treatment response monitoring
-   Athlete screening

## Parameters Measured in Echocardiography

### Left Ventricle Evaluation

| Parameter                          | Normal Value |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Ejection fraction (EF)             | 55-70%       |
| Left ventricle diameter (diastole) | 35-56 mm     |
| Left ventricle diameter (systole)  | 25-40 mm     |
| Wall thickness                     | 6-11 mm      |

### Valve Evaluation

-   Valve structure and movement
-   Stenosis degree
-   Regurgitation degree
-   Valve area calculation
-   Pressure gradients

### Other Measurements

-   Right ventricle function
-   Pulmonary artery pressure
-   Diastolic function
-   Pericardial fluid

## How is Echocardiography Performed?

### Preparation (for TTE)

-   No special preparation required
-   Removal of upper clothing
-   Left lateral lying position

### Procedure Steps

1. **Gel application**: To chest area
2. **Probe placement**: From different windows
3. **Imaging**: Real-time recording
4. **Measurements**: Standard parameters
5. **Reporting**: Detailed evaluation

## Echocardiography Results

### Normal Findings

-   Normal heart size
-   Normal valve function
-   Normal ejection fraction
-   No pericardial fluid

### Abnormal Findings

-   Heart enlargement
-   Valve stenosis or regurgitation
-   Wall motion abnormality
-   Low ejection fraction
-   Pericardial fluid
