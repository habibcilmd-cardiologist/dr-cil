    - question: "Is cardiac catheterization painful?"
      answer: "It is performed under local anesthesia and usually no pain is felt."
    - question: "How long does catheterization take?"
      answer: "Diagnostic procedure takes 30-60 minutes, interventional procedures may take longer."
    - question: "When will I be discharged after catheterization?"
      answer: "Usually same day or next day discharge is possible."
    - question: "What are the risks of catheterization?"
      answer: "Serious complications are rare. Bleeding and infection risk is low."
    - question: "Am I awake during catheterization?"
      answer: "Yes, it is performed under local anesthesia and you are awake throughout the procedure."

Cardiac catheterization is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure performed by placing a catheter into heart chambers and vessels. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in cardiac catheterization procedures.

## What is Cardiac Catheterization?

Cardiac catheterization is advancing a thin tube (catheter) through a blood vessel to the heart. Pressure measurement, imaging, and treatment procedures can be performed.

**Types of Cardiac Catheterization:**

-   Left heart catheterization
-   Right heart catheterization
-   Combined catheterization

## Cardiac Catheterization Indications

### Diagnostic Purposes

-   Coronary artery disease evaluation
-   Valve disease evaluation
-   Heart failure evaluation
-   Congenital heart disease

### Treatment Purposes

-   Coronary angioplasty and stent
-   Balloon valvuloplasty
-   Septal defect closure
-   TAVI

## Left Heart Catheterization

### Indications

-   Coronary artery disease
-   Aortic valve disease
-   Mitral valve disease
-   Left ventricular function

### Measurements

-   Left ventricular pressure
-   Aortic pressure
-   Coronary angiography
-   Ventriculography

## Right Heart Catheterization

### Indications

-   Pulmonary hypertension
-   Heart failure
-   Valve disease
-   Shunt evaluation

### Measurements

-   Right atrial pressure
-   Right ventricular pressure
-   Pulmonary artery pressure
-   Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure
-   Cardiac output

## How is Cardiac Catheterization Performed?

### Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Kidney function tests
-   Blood thinner adjustment

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: To access site
2. **Vascular access**: Femoral or radial
3. **Catheter advancement**: Toward heart
4. **Pressure measurement**: In chambers
5. **Imaging**: With contrast
6. **Treatment**: If needed
7. **Catheter removal**: End of procedure

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 30-60 minutes

## Cardiac Catheterization Results

### Normal Values

| Parameter        | Normal Value       |
| ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Left ventricle   | 100-140/5-12 mmHg  |
| Aorta            | 100-140/60-90 mmHg |
| Right ventricle  | 15-30/0-8 mmHg     |
| Pulmonary artery | 15-30/4-12 mmHg    |

## Complications

-   Bleeding (rare)
-   Infection (rare)
-   Arrhythmia
-   Contrast reaction
-   Vascular injury
