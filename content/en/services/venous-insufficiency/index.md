-   Edema evaluation
-   Skin examination

### Imaging

-   Venous Doppler ultrasonography
-   Reflux evaluation
-   Deep vein evaluation

### Doppler Findings

-   Valve insufficiency
-   Increased vein diameter

## Venous Insufficiency Treatment

### Conservative Treatment

-   Compression stockings
-   Leg elevation
-   Exercise
-   Weight control

### Sclerotherapy

-   In small varicose veins
-   For cosmetic purposes
-   Foam sclerotherapy

### Endovenous Treatment

**Laser Ablation (EVLA):**
