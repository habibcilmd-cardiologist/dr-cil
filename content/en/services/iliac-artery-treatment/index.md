    - question: "What is the iliac artery and why does it become blocked?"
      answer: "Iliac arteries are the main vessels carrying blood from the abdominal aorta to the legs. They can narrow or become blocked due to atherosclerosis, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension."
    - question: "What are the symptoms of iliac artery occlusion?"
      answer: "Leg and hip pain when walking (claudication), cold legs, erectile dysfunction, and rest pain in severe cases."
    - question: "How is iliac artery occlusion treated?"
      answer: "Most cases are treated with stenting. Balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery can also be performed."
    - question: "Is iliac stenting risky?"
      answer: "In experienced centers, it is a low-risk procedure. Success rate is over 95%."
    - question: "Can normal life resume after treatment?"
      answer: "Yes, after successful treatment, most patients are free of symptoms and can return to normal activities."

Iliac artery occlusion treatment encompasses the relief of stenosis or occlusion in the main vessels supplying blood to the legs.

## Iliac Artery Anatomy

The iliac arteries are formed when the abdominal aorta divides into two main branches at the L4-L5 level.

**Anatomical Structure:**

```
Abdominal Aorta
      ↓
Common Iliac Artery
      ↓
   ┌──┴──┐
   ↓     ↓
Internal   External
Iliac      Iliac
   ↓         ↓
Pelvic    Femoral Artery
organs      (Leg)
```

**Clinical Significance:**

- **Common iliac artery:** Aorto-iliac disease
- **External iliac artery:** Leg blood flow
- **Internal iliac artery:** Pelvis, hip, erectile function

## Causes of Iliac Artery Disease

### Primary Causes

**Atherosclerosis (95%):**
- Most common cause
- Plaque buildup
- Calcification

### Risk Factors

| Risk Factor | Effect |
|-------------|--------|
| Smoking | Most important risk factor |
| Diabetes | 4-fold increased risk |
| Hypertension | Endothelial damage |
| Hyperlipidemia | Plaque formation |
| Age >50 | Natural process |

### Other Causes

- Aortic dissection
- Trauma
- Vasculitis
- Radiation

## TASC II Classification

Anatomical classification of iliac lesions:

| TASC | Lesion Type | Preferred Treatment |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **A** | Unilateral CIA/EIA <3 cm stenosis | Endovascular |
| **B** | 3-10 cm stenosis, unilateral occlusion | Endovascular |
| **C** | Bilateral stenosis, unilateral EIA occlusion | Endovascular/Surgery |
| **D** | Aorto-iliac occlusion, diffuse disease | Surgery (primarily) |

## Symptoms of Iliac Artery Disease

### Claudication (Intermittent Limping)

**Most common symptom:**

- Leg/hip pain when walking
- Improves with rest
- Starts at a certain distance
- Leriche syndrome (bilateral)

### Leriche Syndrome

Bilateral aorto-iliac occlusion triad:

1. Bilateral hip and leg claudication
2. Erectile dysfunction
3. Absence of femoral pulses

### Critical Limb Ischemia

Advanced stage disease:

- Rest pain
- Trophic changes
- Non-healing wounds
- Gangrene risk

## Diagnostic Methods

### Physical Examination

- Femoral pulse assessment
- ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index) measurement
- Bruit check

### Imaging

**Doppler Ultrasound:**
- First line
- Flow velocities
- Stenosis localization

**CT Angiography:**
- Detailed anatomical imaging
- Calcification assessment
- Treatment planning

**MR Angiography:**
- Non-contrast option
- Soft tissue detail

**DSA (Digital Subtraction Angiography):**
- Gold standard
- Same-session treatment

## Endovascular Treatment

### Balloon Angioplasty

**Indications:**
- Short segment stenosis
- Non-calcified lesions
- Focal disease

### Iliac Stenting

**Primary treatment method:**

**Stent Types:**

| Type | Feature | Indication |
|------|---------|------------|
| Balloon-expandable | Precise placement | Ostial, calcified |
| Self-expanding | Flexibility | Long segment, tortuous |
| Covered stent | Wall support | Rupture, aneurysm |

**Technical Success:** >95%

### Kissing Stent Technique

For aorto-iliac bifurcation lesions:

- Bilateral simultaneous stenting
- Preservation of aortic bifurcation
- Long-term patency: 85-90% (5 years)

### Hybrid Procedures

Endovascular + Surgical combination:

- Iliac stent + Femoral endarterectomy
- For complex disease
- Less invasive approach

## Treatment Outcomes

### Primary Patency Rates

| Lesion | 1 Year | 5 Years |
|--------|--------|---------|
| TASC A/B | 95% | 85% |
| TASC C | 90% | 75% |
| TASC D | 85% | 70% |

### Clinical Improvement

- Claudication distance: Average 3-4 fold increase
- Quality of life: Significant improvement
- Amputation risk: Significant reduction

## Complications

### Early Complications

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Access site hematoma | 3-5% | Compression |
| Distal embolization | 1-2% | Aspiration/Thrombolysis |
| Rupture | <1% | Covered stent |
| Dissection | 2-3% | Stenting |

### Late Complications

- In-stent restenosis: 5-10% (per year)
- Stent fracture: Rare
- Thrombosis: Antiplatelet non-compliance

## Medical Treatment

### Basic Approach

Medical optimization in all patients:

- **Antiplatelet:** Aspirin ± Clopidogrel
- **Statin:** LDL <70 mg/dL target
- **Blood pressure:** <140/90 mmHg
- **Diabetes control:** HbA1c <7%

### Lifestyle Modifications

- **Smoking cessation:** Most important intervention
- **Exercise program:** Supervised walking
- **Diet:** Low fat, low salt

## Surgical Treatment

### Indications

- If endovascular treatment not suitable
- TASC D lesions
- Failed endovascular intervention

### Surgical Options

- **Aorto-bifemoral bypass:** Standard
- **Ilio-femoral bypass:** Unilateral
- **Axillo-femoral bypass:** High-risk patients

## Follow-up Protocol

### Regular Check-ups

- 1 month: Clinical evaluation
- 6 months: Doppler US + ABI
- Annual: CT Angiography (if needed)

### Medication Compliance

- Antiplatelet therapy: Lifelong
- Statin: Lifelong
- Risk factor control: Continuous
