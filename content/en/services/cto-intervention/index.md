faq:
    - question: "Is CTO intervention better than bypass surgery?"
      answer: "Both treatments have advantages. CTO intervention is minimally invasive with shorter recovery time. However, bypass may be more appropriate in multi-vessel disease or complex anatomy. The decision is made based on individual assessment."
    - question: "How long does CTO intervention take?"
      answer: "CTO intervention takes longer than standard angioplasty. A typical procedure ranges from 1-3 hours and may be longer in complex cases."
    - question: "What happens if CTO intervention fails?"
      answer: "After unsuccessful intervention, the patient is usually followed with medical treatment. In some cases, a second attempt may be tried or bypass surgery may be considered."
    - question: "How long is recovery after CTO intervention?"
      answer: "Most patients are discharged within 1-2 days and can return to normal activities within 1 week. Full recovery takes 2-4 weeks."
    - question: "Can every CTO be opened?"
      answer: "No, some CTOs may not be openable due to anatomical or technical reasons. However, with experienced operators and modern techniques, success rates have exceeded 90%."

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a condition where a coronary artery has been completely blocked for at least 3 months. CTO intervention is an advanced cardiological procedure that enables opening of these blocked vessels using special techniques.

## What is CTO?

Chronic total occlusion (CTO) is a condition where a coronary artery is 100% blocked and this blockage has persisted for at least 3 months. CTO is detected in approximately 15-25% of patients undergoing coronary angiography.

Characteristics of CTO:

-   Vessel is completely blocked (TIMI flow 0)
-   Blockage has been present for at least 3 months
-   Contains hard, fibrotic, and calcified tissue
-   Collateral vessels have developed

## Why is CTO Important?

The heart muscle in the blocked vessel area is supplied through collateral (side) vessels. However, this supply is usually insufficient and leads to:

-   **Angina**: Chest pain occurring with exertion
-   **Shortness of breath**: Especially with exertion
-   **Heart failure**: In the long term
-   **Arrhythmias**: Due to scar tissue
-   **Decreased quality of life**: Limitation of daily activities

## Who is CTO Intervention Suitable For?

Patient selection for CTO intervention should be done carefully:

### Indications

-   Angina persisting despite medical treatment
-   Presence of viable myocardium in CTO territory
-   CTO supplying a large myocardial area
-   Symptoms affecting quality of life
-   Patients unsuitable for bypass surgery

### Contraindications

-   No viable tissue in CTO territory (scar)
-   Very small vessel
-   Patients with short life expectancy
-   Severe comorbidities

## Pre-CTO Intervention Evaluation

Comprehensive planning is required for successful CTO intervention:

**Imaging:**

-   Coronary angiography (bilateral injection)
-   Coronary CT angiography
-   Myocardial viability testing (MRI, PET, SPECT)

**Lesion Assessment:**

-   J-CTO score (difficulty level)
-   Occlusion length
-   Degree of calcification
-   Collateral vessel quality
-   Proximal cap morphology

## CTO Intervention Techniques

CTO intervention requires special techniques different from standard angioplasty:

### Antegrade Approach

Approaching the occlusion in the normal flow direction (proximal to distal):

**Antegrade Wire Escalation (AWE):**

-   Crossing the occlusion with guidewires of different stiffness
-   First preferred technique
-   Successful in short, straight CTOs

**Antegrade Dissection and Re-entry (ADR):**

-   Entry into subintimal space
-   Controlled dissection
-   Re-entry to true lumen (CrossBoss, Stingray)

### Retrograde Approach

Approaching the occlusion from the reverse direction through collateral vessels:

-   Septal collaterals (most common)
-   Epicardial collaterals
-   Bypass grafts

**Retrograde Wire Escalation:**

-   Reaching distal cap through collateral
-   Crossing the occlusion from reverse direction

**Reverse CART (Controlled Antegrade and Retrograde Tracking):**

-   Meeting of antegrade and retrograde wires
-   Gold standard in complex CTOs

### Hybrid Approach

The "hybrid algorithm" is used in modern CTO intervention:

1. Strategy determination based on lesion characteristics
2. Rapid technique change in case of failure
3. Combination of antegrade and retrograde techniques

## Special Equipment Used in CTO Intervention

| Equipment      | Usage Area                         |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Microcatheters | Wire support and exchange          |
| CTO guidewires | Different stiffness and tip shapes |
| CrossBoss      | Subintimal crossing                |
| Stingray       | Re-entry                           |
| Rotablation    | Calcified lesions                  |
| IVUS/OCT       | Intravascular imaging              |

## CTO Intervention Success Rates

Success rates with experienced CTO operators:

-   **Overall success rate**: 85-90%
-   **With antegrade techniques**: 60-70%
-   **With retrograde techniques**: 80-90% (in antegrade failure cases)
-   **With hybrid approach**: 90%+

Factors affecting success:

-   Operator experience
-   Lesion complexity (J-CTO score)
-   Appropriate equipment
-   Patient selection

## CTO Intervention Risks

CTO intervention carries higher risk compared to standard angioplasty:

**Common (1-5%):**

-   Access site complications
-   Contrast nephropathy
-   Radiation exposure (long procedure time)

**Rare (<1%):**

-   Coronary perforation
-   Tamponade
-   Collateral damage
-   Myocardial infarction
-   Need for emergency bypass
-   Death

## After CTO Intervention

After successful CTO intervention:

**Short Term:**

-   Rapid improvement in symptoms
-   Increase in exercise capacity
-   Improvement in quality of life

**Long Term:**

-   Improvement in left ventricular function
-   Decrease in arrhythmias
-   Survival advantage (in some studies)
