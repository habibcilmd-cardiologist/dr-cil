faq:
    - question: "Is angioplasty a painful procedure?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and sedation, so no pain is felt. There may be a brief pressure sensation in the chest when the balloon is inflated, but this lasts only a few seconds."
    - question: "How long should I take medication after stent?"
      answer: "Aspirin is taken for life, the second antiplatelet medication (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, or prasugrel) is usually taken for 6-12 months. Duration is adjusted according to individual risk assessment."
    - question: "Can I have an MRI after stent placement?"
      answer: "Yes, modern stents are MRI compatible. MRI can be safely performed 6 weeks after the procedure."
    - question: "Can I exercise after stent?"
      answer: "Yes, exercise is possible after the recovery period. Safe exercise level is determined through cardiac rehabilitation program."
    - question: "Does the stent stay for life?"
      answer: "Yes, the stent is permanent and integrates into the vessel wall over time. It is accepted by the body and does not affect normal life."

Coronary angioplasty is a procedure to open blocked or narrowed coronary arteries using balloons and stents. Also known as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), this treatment plays a life-saving role in treating heart attacks and angina. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has performed thousands of successful angioplasty procedures with over 20 years of experience.

## What is Coronary Angioplasty?

Coronary angioplasty is a procedure to open narrowed or blocked coronary arteries via catheter. During the procedure, a thin balloon catheter is placed inside the vessel, inflated to widen the narrowing, and usually a stent (metal mesh) is placed to keep the vessel open.

This procedure enables treatment of coronary artery disease without requiring open-heart surgery. First performed by Dr. Andreas Grüntzig in 1977, angioplasty is now one of the most commonly performed cardiac interventions.

## When is Angioplasty Needed?

Coronary angioplasty is performed in the following situations:

### Emergency Situations

-   **Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)**: Called primary PCI
-   **Unstable angina**: Chest pain not responding to medical treatment
-   **Cardiogenic shock**: When the heart pump is insufficient

### Elective (Planned) Situations

-   Angina persisting despite medical treatment
-   Significant ischemia findings on stress testing
-   Functionally significant narrowings (FFR ≤0.80)
-   Symptoms affecting quality of life

## Pre-Procedure Preparation

A comprehensive evaluation is performed before angioplasty:

**Diagnostic Tests:**

-   Coronary angiography (imaging of narrowings)
-   Echocardiography (heart function)
-   Blood tests (kidney function, blood count)
-   ECG

**Patient Preparation:**

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Loading dose of antiplatelet medications
-   Precautions if contrast allergy exists
-   Informed consent

## How is Angioplasty Performed?

The procedure is performed in the catheterization laboratory:

### 1. Vascular Access

-   **Radial approach (wrist)**: Preferred method, fewer complications
-   **Femoral approach (groin)**: In complex cases or if radial is not suitable

### 2. Coronary Angiography

-   Guide catheter is placed at the coronary artery ostium
-   Vessels are imaged by injecting contrast material
-   Location and severity of narrowing is determined

### 3. Balloon Angioplasty

-   Thin guidewire is passed through the narrowing
-   Balloon catheter is positioned at the narrowing site
-   Balloon is inflated to compress plaque and widen the vessel

### 4. Stent Placement

-   Stent is delivered to the narrowing site folded on a balloon
-   Balloon is inflated to press the stent against the vessel wall
-   Balloon is deflated and removed, stent remains permanently

### 5. Result Control

-   Result is evaluated with angiographic imaging
-   Optimal stent expansion is checked
-   Complication check is performed

## Stent Types

Stent types used in modern cardiology:

| Stent Type               | Feature                 | Usage Area                  |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Drug-Eluting Stent (DES) | Low restenosis rate     | Standard choice             |
| Bare Metal Stent (BMS)   | Short-term antiplatelet | High bleeding risk patients |
| Bioresorbable Stent      | Dissolves over time     | Selected young patients     |

## Complex Angioplasty Procedures

Some situations require special techniques:

**Bifurcation Lesions:**

-   Narrowings at the junction of two vessels
-   Various stenting techniques (crush, culotte, T-stent)

**Calcified Lesions:**

-   Rotablation (high-speed rotating burr)
-   Intravascular lithotripsy (shock wave)
-   Cutting/scoring balloon

**Long Lesions:**

-   Overlapping stent technique
-   Long stent use

**Left Main Coronary Disease:**

-   High-risk procedure
-   With intravascular imaging guidance (IVUS/OCT)

## Post-Procedure Care

Things to consider after angioplasty:

**In Hospital:**

-   4-6 hours bed rest (shorter with radial access)
-   Access site monitoring
-   Cardiac monitoring
-   Hydration (for contrast elimination)

**After Discharge:**

-   Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor)
-   Statin therapy
-   Risk factor control
-   Cardiac rehabilitation

## Angioplasty Risks

Like any interventional procedure, angioplasty has risks:

**Common (1-5%):**

-   Access site bleeding or hematoma
-   Contrast nephropathy
-   Transient rhythm disturbances

**Rare (<1%):**

-   Coronary artery dissection
-   Acute stent thrombosis
-   Myocardial infarction
-   Stroke
-   Need for emergency bypass surgery
-   Death

These risks are minimized with experienced hands and modern techniques.

## Medication After Stent

Medication adherence after stent is critically important:

**Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT):**

-   Aspirin (lifelong)
-   P2Y12 inhibitor (6-12 months)
    -   Clopidogrel
    -   Ticagrelor
    -   Prasugrel

**Other Medications:**

-   High-dose statin
-   Beta-blocker (if needed)
-   ACE inhibitor/ARB

⚠️ **Important**: Never stop medications without doctor approval! Early medication discontinuation increases stent thrombosis risk.

## Long-Term Outcomes

With modern drug-eluting stents:

-   **Restenosis rate**: <5%
-   **Stent thrombosis**: <1%
-   **5-year patency rate**: >90%
