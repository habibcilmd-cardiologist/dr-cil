Heart bypass surgery is a surgical procedure that provides blood flow to the heart muscle by creating a new vessel pathway around blocked coronary arteries. Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in pre and post bypass surgery evaluation.

## What is Heart Bypass?

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is creating a new vessel pathway around blocked or severely stenosed coronary arteries. Vessels taken from other parts of the body are used.

**Types of Bypass Grafts:**

-   Left internal mammary artery (LIMA)
-   Right internal mammary artery (RIMA)
-   Saphenous vein graft
-   Radial artery graft

## Bypass Indications

### Definite Indications

-   Left main coronary disease
-   Three-vessel disease
-   Multivessel disease with low ejection fraction
-   Diabetic multivessel disease

### Relative Indications

-   Lesions not suitable for PCI
-   Failed PCI
-   Recurrent angina

## How is Bypass Surgery Performed?

### Preoperative Preparation

-   Comprehensive cardiac evaluation
-   Angiography
-   Echocardiography
-   Laboratory tests

### Surgical Techniques

**Conventional CABG:**

-   With cardiopulmonary bypass
-   Heart stopped
-   Sternotomy

**Off-Pump Bypass:**

-   Without cardiopulmonary bypass
-   Heart beating
-   In selected patients

**Minimally Invasive CABG:**

-   Small incisions
-   Robot-assisted
-   Fast recovery

### Surgery Duration

Total duration: 3-6 hours

## Post-Bypass Recovery

### Hospital Stay

-   Intensive care: 1-2 days
-   Ward: 5-7 days
-   Total: 7-10 days

### Home Recovery

-   First 2 weeks: Bed rest
-   4-6 weeks: Light activity
-   8-12 weeks: Normal activity
-   3 months: Full recovery

## Bypass Results

### Success Rates

-   Surgical success: >95%
-   10-year survival: 80-90%
-   Symptom improvement: >90%

### Complications

-   Bleeding
-   Infection
-   Arrhythmia
-   Kidney failure
-   Stroke (rare)

## Bypass vs PCI

| Feature             | Bypass | PCI      |
| ------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Invasiveness        | High   | Low      |
| Recovery            | Long   | Short    |
| Long-term           | Better | Variable |
| Repeat intervention | Low    | High     |
