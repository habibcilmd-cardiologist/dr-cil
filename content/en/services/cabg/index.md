Heart bypass surgery is a surgical procedure that provides blood flow to the heart muscle by creating a new vessel pathway around blocked coronary arteries. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in pre and post bypass surgery evaluation.

## What is Heart Bypass?

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is creating a new vessel pathway around blocked or severely stenosed coronary arteries. Vessels taken from other parts of the body are used.

**Types of Bypass Grafts:**

-   Left internal mammary artery (LIMA)
-   Right internal mammary artery (RIMA)
-   Saphenous vein graft
-   Radial artery graft

## Bypass Indications

### Definite Indications

-   Left main coronary disease
-   Three-vessel disease
-   Multivessel disease with low ejection fraction
-   Diabetic multivessel disease

### Relative Indications

-   Lesions not suitable for PCI
-   Failed PCI
-   Recurrent angina

## How is Bypass Surgery Performed?

### Preoperative Preparation

-   Comprehensive cardiac evaluation
-   Angiography

### Surgical Techniques

**Conventional CABG:**

**Off-Pump Bypass:**

-   Heart beating
-   In selected patients

**Minimally Invasive CABG:**

-   Small incisions
-   Robot-assisted
-   Fast recovery

### Surgery Duration

Total duration: 3-6 hours

## Post-Bypass Recovery
