    - question: "Is pulmonary stenosis dangerous?"
      answer: "Severe pulmonary stenosis can lead to right heart failure. Treatment is important."
    - question: "How is pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty performed?"
      answer: "A catheter is inserted through the groin to reach the pulmonary valve and the valve is opened by inflating a balloon."
    - question: "Is pulmonary balloon valvuloplasty permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, it provides long-lasting effect in most patients."
    - question: "Can I exercise with pulmonary valve disease?"
      answer: "In mild disease, yes. Heavy exercise should be restricted in severe disease."
    - question: "Does pulmonary regurgitation require treatment?"
      answer: "Mild regurgitation usually does not require treatment. Valve replacement may be needed in severe regurgitation."

Pulmonary valve disease is dysfunction of the valve between the **right ventricle** and the **pulmonary artery**. The two main forms are **pulmonary stenosis** and **pulmonary regurgitation**.

This page provides a more clinically detailed overview of treatment options, especially **balloon valvuloplasty** and, when indicated, **pulmonary valve replacement/implantation**.

## What is Pulmonary Valve Disease?

The pulmonary valve regulates blood flow from the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. In valve disease, this function is impaired and creates additional burden on the right heart.

**Types of Pulmonary Valve Disease:**

-   Pulmonary stenosis
-   Pulmonary regurgitation
-   Combined pulmonary valve disease

## Pulmonary Stenosis

### Causes

-   Congenital (most common)
-   Rheumatic disease (rare)
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Tumor

### Symptoms

-   Shortness of breath
-   Fatigue
-   Exercise intolerance
-   Syncope (in severe cases)
-   Cyanosis (in advanced cases)

### Grading

| Grade    | Peak Gradient |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Mild     | <36 mmHg      |
| Moderate | 36-64 mmHg    |
| Severe   | >64 mmHg      |

## Pulmonary Regurgitation

### Causes

-   Pulmonary hypertension
-   Endocarditis
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Post-surgical (Tetralogy of Fallot)
-   Congenital

### Symptoms

-   Usually asymptomatic
-   Right heart failure signs (advanced stage)
-   Exercise intolerance

### Grading

-   Mild: Narrow jet width
-   Moderate: Moderate jet width
-   Severe: Wide jet, right ventricular dilation

## Pulmonary Valve Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Systolic ejection murmur (stenosis)
-   Diastolic murmur (regurgitation)
-   Right ventricular heave

### Imaging

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Cardiac MRI
-   Cardiac CT
-   Right heart catheterization

## Pulmonary Valve Disease Treatment

The treatment plan is individualized based on severity, symptoms, right ventricular function, associated heart conditions, and overall procedural risk.

### Pulmonary Stenosis Treatment

**Balloon Valvuloplasty:**

-   First-line treatment
-   High success rate
-   Minimally invasive
-   Long-lasting effect

**Surgery:**

-   In dysplastic valves
-   If balloon fails

### Pulmonary Regurgitation Treatment

**Medical Treatment:**

-   Right heart failure treatment
-   Diuretics

**Surgical/Interventional:**

-   Pulmonary valve replacement
-   Transcatheter pulmonary valve (Melody, Sapien)

## Pulmonary Valve Implantation / Replacement: When Is It Considered?

Pulmonary valve replacement is commonly considered in settings such as:

- Severe pulmonary regurgitation with right ventricular dilation/dysfunction (often in patients with repaired congenital heart disease)
- Severe stenosis that is not suitable for balloon valvuloplasty, or residual/recurrent obstruction after prior interventions

In selected patients, **transcatheter pulmonary valve implantation (TPVI)** may be an alternative to surgery after careful anatomical evaluation.

## Pulmonary Balloon Valvuloplasty

### Procedure Steps

1. Femoral vein access
2. Right heart catheterization
3. Crossing pulmonary valve
4. Balloon inflation
5. Gradient measurement

### Success Rate

-   Over 90% success
-   Long-lasting effect
-   Low complication rate

### Possible Risks (General)

Risk varies by patient and anatomy. Examples include access-site bleeding/bruising, rhythm disturbances, valve injury or increased regurgitation (uncommon), and rare thromboembolic events.
