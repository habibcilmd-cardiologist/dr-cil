    - question: "Is pacemaker implantation painful?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia, so no pain is felt. There may be mild pain and discomfort after the procedure, but it is controlled with pain relievers."
    - question: "How long does a pacemaker last?"
      answer: "Modern pacemakers typically work for 8-15 years. When the battery runs out, only the generator is replaced; the electrodes usually remain in place."
    - question: "Can I have an MRI with a pacemaker?"
      answer: "MRI can be performed with new generation MRI-compatible pacemakers. However, you should consult your doctor beforehand and special precautions must be taken."
    - question: "Can I exercise with a pacemaker?"
      answer: "Yes, most sports activities can be done. However, contact sports and activities with risk of impact to the pacemaker area should be avoided."
    - question: "How often are pacemaker check-ups done?"
      answer: "Check-ups are generally recommended every 6-12 months. More frequent monitoring is possible with remote monitoring systems."

A permanent pacemaker is a small electronic device used to treat slow heartbeat (bradycardia) or conduction disorders. This device, placed under the chest skin, ensures the heart beats regularly.

## What is a Pacemaker?

A pacemaker is a small device that monitors the heart's electrical activity and delivers electrical stimulation when needed. It consists of two main components:

1. **Generator (Battery)**: Contains the battery and electronic circuits
2. **Electrodes (Leads)**: Wires that transmit electrical stimulation to the heart

Modern pacemakers are credit card-sized and can work for 8-15 years.

## Who Needs a Pacemaker?

### Indications

**Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate):**

-   Sinus node dysfunction (sick sinus syndrome)
-   Symptomatic bradycardia
-   Chronotropic incompetence

**Heart Blocks:**

-   Complete AV block (3rd degree)
-   Advanced 2nd degree AV block
-   Symptomatic 1st degree AV block

**Other Conditions:**

-   Carotid sinus hypersensitivity
-   Neurocardiogenic syncope
-   Certain cardiomyopathies

### Symptoms

Symptoms of conditions requiring a pacemaker:

-   Dizziness
-   Fainting (syncope)
-   Fatigue
-   Shortness of breath
-   Exercise intolerance
-   Confusion

## Types of Pacemakers

### Single-Chamber Pacemaker

-   Single electrode (usually right ventricle)
-   Simple bradycardia treatment
-   Chronic atrial fibrillation + bradycardia

### Dual-Chamber Pacemaker

-   Two electrodes (right atrium + right ventricle)
-   Preserves AV synchrony
-   More physiological pacing
-   Most commonly used type

### Three-Chamber Pacemaker (CRT)

-   Three electrodes (right atrium + right ventricle + left ventricle)
-   Heart failure treatment
-   Cardiac resynchronization

### Leadless Pacemaker

-   Wireless, capsule-shaped
-   Placed directly in the heart
-   In selected patients

## How is Pacemaker Implantation Performed?

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

-   Blood tests
-   ECG and echocardiography
-   Chest X-ray
-   Adjustment of anticoagulant medications
-   Fasting (6-8 hours)

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: Area below collarbone is numbed
2. **Pocket creation**: Pocket for battery is created under skin
3. **Vascular access**: Subclavian or cephalic vein is used
4. **Electrode placement**: Placed in heart under fluoroscopy guidance
5. **Testing**: Proper function of electrodes is verified
6. **Generator connection**: Electrodes are connected to battery
7. **Pocket closure**: Skin is closed with sutures

### Procedure Duration

A typical pacemaker implantation takes 1-2 hours.

## Post-Procedure Care

### In Hospital

-   24-48 hours observation
-   Chest X-ray control
-   Pacemaker programming
-   Wound care

### After Discharge

**First 4-6 Weeks:**

-   Don't raise arm above shoulder level
-   Don't lift heavy objects (>5 kg)
-   Keep wound area dry
-   Don't drive

**Long Term:**

-   Regular check-ups (every 6-12 months)
-   Carry pacemaker ID card with you
-   Consult your doctor before MRI
-   Don't keep cell phone on pacemaker side

## Pacemaker Risks

Procedure risks are low but may include:

**Early Complications:**

-   Bleeding or hematoma
-   Infection
-   Pneumothorax (lung injury)
-   Electrode dislocation
-   Heart perforation (rare)

**Late Complications:**

-   Electrode fracture
-   Pocket erosion
-   Venous thrombosis
-   Pacemaker syndrome

## Living with a Pacemaker

You can lead a normal life with a pacemaker:

**What You Can Do:**

-   Normal daily activities
-   Exercise and sports (with doctor approval)
-   Travel (including flying)
-   Sexual activity
-   Shower and bath

**Things to Consider:**

-   Avoid strong magnetic fields
-   Inform security when passing through airport gates
-   Consult your doctor before certain medical procedures
-   Attend regular check-ups
