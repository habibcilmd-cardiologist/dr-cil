    - question: "What is a coronary fistula?"
      answer: "A coronary fistula is an abnormal connection between a coronary artery and a cardiac chamber or pulmonary vessels. It can be congenital or acquired."
    - question: "Is coronary fistula dangerous?"
      answer: "Small fistulas are usually harmless. Large fistulas may cause heart failure, angina, or endocarditis."
    - question: "How is coronary fistula treated?"
      answer: "Catheter-based closure with coils or plugs is preferred. Large fistulas may require surgery."
    - question: "Is coronary fistula closure risky?"
      answer: "In experienced centers, the risk is low. Success rate exceeds 95%."
    - question: "What is life like after coronary fistula closure?"
      answer: "After successful closure, patients can return to normal life. Regular follow-up is recommended."

Coronary fistula treatment involves closing abnormal connections between coronary arteries and heart chambers or major vessels.

## What is a Coronary Fistula?

Coronary arteriovenous fistula (CAVF) is an abnormal connection between coronary arteries and cardiac chambers (atrium or ventricle) or structures such as the pulmonary artery or coronary sinus.

**Types of Fistulas:**

- **Coronary-Cameral Fistula:** Coronary artery → Cardiac chamber
- **Coronary-Pulmonary Fistula:** Coronary artery → Pulmonary artery
- **Coronary-Coronary Sinus Fistula:** Coronary artery → Coronary sinus

## Causes of Coronary Fistula

### Congenital (From Birth)

- Most common cause
- Embryonic developmental anomaly
- Usually single fistula

### Acquired

- Chest trauma
- Post cardiac surgery
- Post coronary interventions
- Myocardial infarction
- Infective endocarditis

## Coronary Fistula Classification

### By Drainage Site

| Drainage Site | Frequency |
|---------------|-----------|
| Right ventricle | 40% |
| Right atrium | 25% |
| Pulmonary artery | 17% |
| Left ventricle | 7% |
| Left atrium | 5% |
| Coronary sinus | 6% |

### By Size

- **Small fistula:** <3 mm
- **Medium fistula:** 3-5 mm
- **Large fistula:** >5 mm

## Coronary Fistula Symptoms

### Asymptomatic

Small fistulas often have no symptoms. Discovered incidentally.

### Symptomatic

Large fistulas may present with complaints:

- **Dyspnea:** Especially with exertion
- **Chest pain:** Angina-like
- **Palpitations:** Due to arrhythmia
- **Fatigue:** Sign of heart failure
- **Murmur:** Continuous murmur may be heard

### Complications

- Heart failure
- Coronary steal syndrome
- Myocardial ischemia
- Infective endocarditis
- Fistula rupture (rare)
- Aneurysmal dilation

## Coronary Fistula Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

- Continuous murmur
- Heart failure signs

### Imaging Methods

**Echocardiography:**
- First-line evaluation
- Dilated coronary artery visualization
- Doppler flow detection

**Coronary Angiography:**
- Gold standard diagnostic method
- Shows fistula anatomy
- Identifies drainage site

**Cardiac CT Angiography:**
- Non-invasive evaluation
- 3D anatomical imaging
- For surgical planning

**Cardiac MRI:**
- Shunt quantification
- Functional assessment

## Coronary Fistula Treatment

### Treatment Indications

Conditions requiring treatment:

- Symptomatic patients
- Large fistulas (>3mm)
- Increased left ventricular load
- Coronary steal syndrome
- History of endocarditis

### Conservative Follow-up

For small, asymptomatic fistulas:

- Regular echocardiography
- Endocarditis prophylaxis
- Symptom monitoring

### Transcatheter Closure

**Preferred method:**

Catheter-based fistula closure:

**Devices Used:**
- Coils
- Amplatzer vascular plug
- Covered stent

**Advantages:**
- Minimally invasive
- Short hospital stay
- Low complication risk
- Quick recovery

**Procedure Steps:**
1. Arterial access (femoral/radial)
2. Selective coronary angiography
3. Wire advancement into fistula
4. Coil or plug placement
5. Control angiography

### Surgical Treatment

Preferred in these situations:

- Very large fistulas
- Aneurysmal dilation
- Transcatheter failure
- Concomitant cardiac pathology

**Surgical Techniques:**
- Fistula ligation
- Fistula excision
- Combined with coronary bypass

## Treatment Outcomes

### Transcatheter Closure

- Procedural success: >95%
- Complete closure: 90-95%
- Residual shunt: <5-10%
- Major complication: <2%

### Long-term Follow-up

- Echocardiography control
- Residual shunt assessment
- Endocarditis risk monitoring
