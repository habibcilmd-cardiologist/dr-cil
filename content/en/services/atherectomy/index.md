Atherectomy is mechanical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from inside the vessel. It is used especially in calcified lesions and situations where stent placement is difficult. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in atherectomy procedures.

## What is Atherectomy?

Atherectomy is cutting, scraping, or vaporizing plaque from the vessel wall using special devices at the catheter tip. It is an alternative or complementary method to balloon angioplasty and stenting.

**Types of Atherectomy:**

-   Rotational atherectomy
-   Orbital atherectomy
-   Directional atherectomy
-   Laser atherectomy

## Atherectomy Indications

### Coronary Arteries

-   Severely calcified lesions
-   Lesions that cannot be crossed with balloon
-   Inadequate stent expansion
-   Bifurcation lesions

### Peripheral Arteries

-   Lower extremity arterial disease
-   Calcified peripheral lesions
-   In-stent restenosis
-   Critical limb ischemia

## Types of Atherectomy

### Rotational Atherectomy (Rotablator)

-   Diamond-coated burr
-   High-speed rotation
-   Grinds calcified plaque
-   Commonly used in coronary arteries

### Orbital Atherectomy

-   Eccentric rotation
-   Abrades calcified plaque
-   Less thermal damage

### Directional Atherectomy

-   Cuts and collects plaque
-   In larger arteries
-   Histological examination possible

### Laser Atherectomy

-   Excimer laser
-   Vaporizes plaque
-   Effective in in-stent restenosis

## Pre-Atherectomy Preparation

### Evaluation

-   Angiography
-   Intravascular imaging (IVUS/OCT)
-   Calcification assessment

### Patient Preparation

-   Antiplatelet therapy
-   Hydration
-   Kidney function

## How is Atherectomy Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Femoral or radial
2. **Guide catheter**: To target artery
3. **Guidewire**: Crossing lesion
4. **Atherectomy device**: Plaque removal
5. **Balloon angioplasty**: If needed
6. **Stent**: If needed
7. **Control imaging**: Result evaluation

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 1-3 hours

## Atherectomy Results

### Success Criteria

-   Lumen enlargement
-   Improved stent expansion
-   Flow improvement
-   Symptom improvement

### Complications

-   Distal embolization
-   Perforation (rare)
-   Slow flow
-   Spasm
