    - question: "What is chronic DVT?"
      answer: "Chronic DVT is deep vein thrombosis that has been present for more than 14 days. The clot is organized and adherent to the vessel wall."
    - question: "What is post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS)?"
      answer: "PTS is chronic leg swelling, pain, and skin changes that develop after DVT due to venous valve damage and obstruction."
    - question: "Can chronic DVT be treated?"
      answer: "Yes, chronic iliofemoral vein occlusions can be opened with venous stenting. This significantly reduces PTS symptoms."
    - question: "When should chronic DVT treatment be considered?"
      answer: "It should be considered in patients with persistent severe leg swelling, pain, and skin changes despite medical treatment."
    - question: "Does a venous stent stay for life?"
      answer: "Yes, venous stents are permanent. With regular anticoagulation and follow-up, long-term patency is around 70-80%."

Chronic DVT treatment encompasses opening long-standing deep vein occlusions and managing post-thrombotic syndrome.

## What is Chronic DVT?

Chronic DVT is deep vein thrombosis that has persisted for more than 14 days from symptom onset. At this stage, the clot is organized, transformed into fibrous tissue, and adherent to the vessel wall.

**Chronic DVT Characteristics:**

| Feature | Acute DVT | Chronic DVT |
|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Duration | <14 days | >14 days |
| Clot structure | Soft, fresh | Hard, organized |
| Lytic therapy | Effective | Ineffective |
| Main treatment | Thrombolysis | Stenting |

## Post-Thrombotic Syndrome (PTS)

### Definition

PTS is a chronic venous insufficiency syndrome that develops after DVT. It occurs in **20-50%** of patients who have had DVT.

### Pathophysiology

1. **Venous obstruction:** Residual thrombus
2. **Venous reflux:** Valve damage
3. **Venous hypertension:** Chronic pressure increase
4. **Microcirculatory damage:** Tissue changes

### PTS Symptoms

**Early stage:**
- Leg pain and heaviness
- Swelling (especially evening)
- Cramps
- Itching

**Advanced stage:**
- Hyperpigmentation
- Lipodermatosclerosis
- Venous ulcer
- Chronic edema

## PTS Classification

### Villalta Score

| Symptom/Sign | None | Mild | Moderate | Severe |
|--------------|------|------|----------|--------|
| Pain | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Cramps | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Heaviness | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Paresthesia | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Itching | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Edema | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Skin induration | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Hyperpigmentation | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Redness | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Venous ectasia | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Calf pain | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
| Venous ulcer | 0 or 15 | | | |

**Scoring:**
- 0-4: No PTS
- 5-9: Mild PTS
- 10-14: Moderate PTS
- ≥15 or Ulcer: Severe PTS

### CEAP Classification

| Class | Clinical Findings |
|-------|-------------------|
| C0 | No visible venous disease |
| C1 | Telangiectasia, reticular vein |
| C2 | Varicose vein |
| C3 | Edema |
| C4a | Pigmentation, eczema |
| C4b | Lipodermatosclerosis, atrophie blanche |
| C5 | Healed venous ulcer |
| C6 | Active venous ulcer |

## Chronic DVT Diagnosis

### Imaging

**Doppler Ultrasound:**
- First-line evaluation
- Residual obstruction
- Reflux detection

**CT Venography:**
- Iliocaval segment evaluation
- Anatomical detail
- Treatment planning

**MR Venography:**
- Alternative method
- Soft tissue detail

**Ascending Venography:**
- Gold standard
- Pre-intervention evaluation
- Collateral mapping

### Intravascular Ultrasound (IVUS)

**Critical role:**
- True stenosis degree
- Stent sizing
- Procedural success assessment

## Interventional Treatment Indications

### Who is a Candidate?

1. **Iliofemoral segment involvement**
2. **Symptoms unresponsive to medical therapy:**
   - Severe PTS (Villalta ≥15)
   - Active or non-healing venous ulcer
   - Severe edema/pain
3. **Good functional status**
4. **Patient who can receive anticoagulation**

### Contraindications

- Active infection
- Severe coagulopathy
- Short life expectancy
- Inability to receive anticoagulation

## Interventional Treatment Techniques

### Chronic Total Occlusion Recanalization

**Technical Steps:**

1. **Access:** Popliteal or femoral vein
2. **Wire crossing:** Crossing the CTO
3. **Balloon dilation:** Pre-dilation
4. **IVUS evaluation:** True sizing
5. **Stenting:** Self-expanding stent
6. **Post-dilation:** Optimal expansion

### Venous Stenting

**Stent Selection:**

| Feature | Iliac Vein | Femoral Vein |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Diameter | 14-18 mm | 12-14 mm |
| Type | Dedicated venous | Dedicated venous |
| Length | Lesion + 1-2 cm | Lesion + 1 cm |

**Dedicated Venous Stents:**
- Wallstent
- Veniti Vici
- Zilver Vena
- Abre

### Post-Procedure Management

**Anticoagulation:**
- LMWH bridging
- Warfarin (INR 2-3) or DOAC
- Minimum 6-12 months
- Lifelong may be considered in May-Thurner

**Compression:**
- 30-40 mmHg below-knee stockings
- Recommended for 2 years

## Treatment Outcomes

### Technical Success

- Recanalization: 90-95%
- Primary patency (1 year): 70-80%
- Secondary patency (1 year): 85-95%

### Clinical Improvement

| Parameter | Improvement Rate |
|-----------|------------------|
| Swelling | 80-90% |
| Pain | 75-85% |
| Ulcer healing | 60-80% |
| Villalta score | Average 5-7 point decrease |

### Complications

**Early:**
- Access site hematoma: 3-5%
- Stent migration: <1%
- PE: <1%
- Perforation: <1%

**Late:**
- In-stent restenosis: 10-15%
- Stent thrombosis: 5-10%
- Stent fracture: Rare

## Conservative Treatment

### In All Patients

**Compression Therapy:**
- Elastic compression stockings
- 30-40 mmHg
- Symptom control

**Lifestyle:**
- Leg elevation
- Regular exercise
- Weight control

**Medical Treatment:**
- Anticoagulation (continuation)
- Venotonics (limited evidence)
- Wound care (for ulcers)

## Special Situations

### Combined with May-Thurner Syndrome

- Left iliac vein compression
- Decompression with stenting
- Long-term anticoagulation

### Bilateral Involvement

- Staged approach
- Symptomatic side first
- Both sides can be stented

### IVC Involvement

- IVC stenting may be required
- Larger diameter stents
- Careful planning

## Follow-up Protocol

### Regular Check-ups

- 1 week: Clinical check
- 1 month: Doppler US
- 6 months: Doppler US ± CT venography
- Annual: Doppler US

### Monitoring Criteria

- Stent patency
- Symptom changes
- Anticoagulation compliance
- Compression use
