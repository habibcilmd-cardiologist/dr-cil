Exercise stress test is an important diagnostic method that evaluates the heart's performance during exercise. It is widely used in detecting coronary artery disease. Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in exercise stress test evaluation.

## What is an Exercise Stress Test?

An exercise stress test is the monitoring of the heart's electrical activity (ECG) and blood pressure during gradually increasing exercise on a treadmill or bicycle ergometer.

**Purpose of Exercise Stress Test:**

-   Coronary artery disease diagnosis
-   Determination of exercise capacity
-   Evaluation of treatment efficacy
-   Risk stratification

## Exercise Stress Test Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

-   Chest pain evaluation
-   Suspected coronary artery disease
-   Shortness of breath investigation
-   Atypical symptoms

### Prognostic Evaluation

-   Known coronary artery disease
-   Post-myocardial infarction
-   Post-revascularization
-   Heart failure

### Other Indications

-   Athlete screening
-   Exercise prescription
-   Heart valve disease evaluation
-   Arrhythmia evaluation

## Pre-Test Preparation

### General Preparation

-   Light meal up to 3 hours before
-   Comfortable athletic clothing
-   Athletic shoes
-   Caffeine and smoking restriction

### Medication Adjustment

Some medications may be stopped before the test:

-   Beta blockers (with doctor approval)
-   Calcium channel blockers
-   Nitrates

## How is Exercise Stress Test Performed?

### Test Protocol

**Bruce Protocol (Most common):**

-   3-minute stages
-   Speed and incline increase each stage
-   Attempt to reach maximum heart rate

### Procedure Steps

1. **Baseline ECG**: Resting recording
2. **Blood pressure measurement**: Baseline value
3. **Exercise start**: Low speed
4. **Gradual increase**: Every 3 minutes
5. **Maximum effort**: Target heart rate
6. **Recovery**: 5-10 minute monitoring

### Test Duration

Total duration: 15-30 minutes (exercise + recovery)

## Exercise Stress Test Termination Criteria

### Absolute Criteria

-   Severe chest pain
-   Significant ST depression (>2mm)
-   Blood pressure drop
-   Serious arrhythmia
-   Patient request

### Relative Criteria

-   Moderate chest pain
-   Fatigue
-   Shortness of breath
-   Leg pain
-   Hypertensive response

## Exercise Stress Test Results

### Positive Test (Abnormal)

| Finding             | Meaning                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ST depression ≥1mm  | Ischemia               |
| Chest pain          | Angina                 |
| Blood pressure drop | Severe disease         |
| Arrhythmia          | Electrical instability |

### Negative Test (Normal)

-   Target heart rate achieved
-   No ST changes
-   No symptoms
-   Normal blood pressure response

### Inconclusive Test

-   Target heart rate not achieved
-   Uninterpretable ECG changes
-   Additional testing may be needed

## Exercise Stress Test Risks

Risks are low but may include:

-   Chest pain
-   Arrhythmia
-   Blood pressure changes
-   Rarely myocardial infarction
