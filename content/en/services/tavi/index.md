TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation) is a procedure where a new aortic valve is placed via catheter without open-heart surgery in patients with severe aortic stenosis. This revolutionary treatment offers a life-saving option, especially for elderly patients with high surgical risk. TAVI is successfully performed at experienced centers in Turkey, and Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in this field.

## What is TAVI?

TAVI stands for "Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation." In this procedure, a bioprosthetic valve in a folded state is delivered to the heart via catheter without removing the damaged aortic valve, where it opens and begins to function.

TAVI was developed as an alternative to traditional open-heart surgery. First performed in France in 2002, it has now been successfully applied to hundreds of thousands of patients worldwide.

## What is Aortic Stenosis?

The aortic valve is located between the left ventricle and the aorta and ensures one-way blood flow. Aortic stenosis is the narrowing of this valve, making it difficult for blood to pass into the aorta.

### Causes of Aortic Stenosis

-   **Degenerative calcification**: The most common cause, calcium accumulation in the valve with aging
-   **Bicuspid aortic valve**: Congenital two-leaflet valve (normally three leaflets)
-   **Rheumatic heart disease**: Valve damage after rheumatic fever

### Symptoms of Aortic Stenosis

The classic three symptoms of severe aortic stenosis:

1. **Chest pain (angina)**: Pain that occurs with exertion and resolves with rest
2. **Shortness of breath**: Initially with exertion, later at rest
3. **Syncope (fainting)**: Sudden loss of consciousness, especially during exertion

If these symptoms appear and are not treated, the risk of death within 2-5 years is very high.

## Who is TAVI Suitable For?

TAVI is performed in patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis. Patient selection is made by the "Heart Team."

### TAVI Indications

-   **High surgical risk patients**: STS score ≥8% or EuroSCORE II ≥4%
-   **Intermediate surgical risk patients**: With individual assessment
-   **Low surgical risk patients**: In selected cases (over 75 years, suitable anatomy)
-   **Patients unsuitable for surgery**: Porcelain aorta, previous chest radiotherapy

### Contraindications for TAVI

-   Active endocarditis
-   Acute myocardial infarction
-   Severe left ventricular dysfunction (EF <20%)
-   Unsuitable vascular anatomy
-   Life expectancy <1 year

## How is TAVI Performed?

TAVI is performed in a hybrid operating room or catheterization laboratory.

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

-   Comprehensive cardiac evaluation (echocardiography, coronary angiography)
-   Cardiac CT angiography (evaluation of aorta and peripheral vessels)
-   Anesthesia evaluation
-   Blood tests and general health check

### Procedure Steps

**1. Anesthesia**

-   General anesthesia or sedation + local anesthesia

**2. Vascular Access**

-   Transfemoral (groin artery) - most commonly used route
-   Transapical (heart apex) - if femoral route is not suitable
-   Subclavian or transaortic - alternative routes

**3. Valve Placement**

-   Guidewire is passed through the aortic valve
-   Balloon valvuloplasty to expand the valve (in some cases)
-   Folded valve is positioned
-   Valve is deployed and placed

**4. Control and Completion**

-   Valve function is evaluated
-   Paravalvular leak check
-   Vascular access is closed

### Procedure Duration

A typical TAVI procedure takes 1-2 hours. Patients usually stay in the hospital for 1-3 days.

## TAVI Valve Types

Main TAVI valves currently in use:

| Valve Type                | Feature                                |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Edwards SAPIEN 3          | Balloon-expandable, bovine pericardium |
| Medtronic Evolut          | Self-expanding, porcine pericardium    |
| Boston Scientific ACURATE | Self-expanding                         |
| Abbott Portico            | Self-expanding, repositionable         |

Valve selection is based on the patient's anatomy and operator experience.

## Advantages of TAVI

Advantages of TAVI compared to traditional surgical valve replacement:

-   **Minimally invasive**: No sternotomy required
-   **No heart-lung machine needed**: Heart is not stopped
-   **Short hospital stay**: 1-3 days (7-10 days for surgery)
-   **Rapid recovery**: Early return to daily activities
-   **Low complication rate**: In high-risk patients
-   **Local anesthesia option**: For patients with high general anesthesia risk

## TAVI Risks and Complications

Like any medical procedure, TAVI has risks:

**Common Complications:**

-   Vascular complications (5-10%)
-   Permanent pacemaker requirement (5-15%)
-   Paravalvular leak (mild-moderate)
-   Transient rhythm disturbances

**Rare Complications:**

-   Stroke (1-3%)
-   Coronary artery occlusion (<1%)
-   Valve embolization (<1%)
-   Aortic rupture (<1%)
-   Death (1-3%)

These rates are continuously decreasing with modern techniques and experienced teams.

## Life After TAVI

Patients generally recover quickly after TAVI:

**First Week:**

-   Light activities
-   Wound care
-   Medication adjustment

**First Month:**

-   Gradual increase in activity
-   Control echocardiography
-   Start of cardiac rehabilitation

**Long Term:**

-   Annual echocardiography follow-up
-   Antiplatelet therapy (usually aspirin)
-   Endocarditis prophylaxis (before dental procedures)

## TAVI Outcomes

Clinical studies have proven the effectiveness of TAVI:

-   **1-year survival**: 85-90%
-   **5-year survival**: 50-60% (in high-risk patients)
-   **Symptom improvement**: In more than 90% of patients
-   **Quality of life**: Significant improvement

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is TAVI surgery?" >}}
TAVI is not surgery in the traditional sense. The sternum is not cut and the heart is not stopped. It is a minimally invasive procedure performed via catheter. However, it is performed in a hybrid operating room or catheterization laboratory.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How long does a TAVI valve last?" >}}
Modern TAVI valves can last 10-15 years or longer. Long-term data is still being collected, but current results show durability comparable to surgical valves.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Do I need to take blood thinners after TAVI?" >}}
Usually yes. Aspirin and a short-term second antiplatelet medication are recommended for most patients. If there are additional conditions such as atrial fibrillation, anticoagulant therapy may be required.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is the TAVI procedure painful?" >}}
Since the procedure is performed under anesthesia, no pain is felt. There may be mild discomfort in the groin area after the procedure, but this usually resolves within a few days.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When can I return to normal life after TAVI?" >}}
Most patients can return to daily activities within 1-2 weeks. Full recovery usually takes 4-6 weeks. Cardiac rehabilitation program accelerates recovery.
