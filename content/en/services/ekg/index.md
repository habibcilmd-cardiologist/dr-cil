Electrocardiography (ECG/EKG) is a simple, painless, and quick diagnostic method that records the heart's electrical activity. It is one of the most commonly used tests in cardiology. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in ECG interpretation.

## What is an ECG?

An ECG records the electrical signals produced by the heart with each beat through electrodes placed on the skin. This recording provides valuable information about the heart's rhythm, rate, and electrical conduction.

**Parameters Evaluated by ECG:**

-   Heart rate
-   Heart rhythm (regular/irregular)
-   Electrical conduction
-   Heart muscle condition
-   Previous heart attack traces

## ECG Indications

### Symptom Evaluation

-   Chest pain
-   Palpitations
-   Shortness of breath
-   Dizziness
-   Fainting (syncope)
-   Fatigue

### Disease Monitoring

-   Coronary artery disease
-   Heart failure
-   Arrhythmia follow-up
-   Hypertension
-   Heart valve diseases

### Routine Evaluation

-   Pre-operative assessment
-   Check-up
-   Athlete screening
-   Medication monitoring

## How is an ECG Performed?

### Preparation

-   No special preparation required
-   Removal of upper clothing
-   Lying in comfortable position
-   Staying still

### Procedure Steps

1. **Electrode placement**: 10 electrodes (4 limb, 6 chest)
2. **Recording**: Takes a few seconds
3. **Electrode removal**: Gel is cleaned
4. **Results**: Evaluated immediately

### Procedure Duration

ECG recording takes approximately 5-10 minutes.

## ECG Waves and Their Meanings

### Normal ECG Components

| Wave/Segment | Meaning                                 |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| P wave       | Atrial depolarization                   |
| PR interval  | AV conduction time                      |
| QRS complex  | Ventricular depolarization              |
| ST segment   | Beginning of ventricular repolarization |
| T wave       | Ventricular repolarization              |
| QT interval  | Total ventricular activity              |

### Normal Values

-   Heart rate: 60-100/min
-   PR interval: 120-200 ms
-   QRS duration: <120 ms
-   QT interval: Rate-corrected

## Abnormalities Detected on ECG

### Rhythm Disorders

-   Sinus tachycardia/bradycardia
-   Atrial fibrillation
-   Atrial flutter
-   Supraventricular tachycardia
-   Ventricular tachycardia
-   Premature beats (PAC, PVC)

### Conduction Disorders

-   AV blocks (1st, 2nd, 3rd degree)
-   Bundle branch blocks (right/left)
-   Fascicular blocks

### Ischemia/Infarction Findings

-   ST elevation (acute MI)
-   ST depression (ischemia)
-   T wave inversion
-   Q waves (old MI)

### Other Findings

-   Hypertrophy (left/right ventricle)
-   Electrolyte abnormalities
-   Pericarditis
-   Pulmonary embolism findings

## Types of ECG

**Standard 12-Lead ECG:**

-   Most commonly used
-   Imaging heart from different angles

**Holter ECG:**

-   24-48 hour continuous recording
-   Detection of intermittent arrhythmias

**Event Recorder:**

-   Recording at time of symptoms
-   Long-term follow-up

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is an ECG painful?" >}}
No, an ECG is a completely painless procedure. Only electrodes need to be attached to the skin.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is preparation required for an ECG?" >}}
No special preparation is required. However, comfortable clothing may be preferred as the chest area needs to be exposed.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When do ECG results come out?" >}}
ECG results are evaluated and interpreted immediately.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does a normal ECG mean no heart disease?" >}}
A normal ECG is an important finding, but some heart diseases may not be visible on ECG. Additional tests may be needed.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How often should an ECG be done?" >}}
Determined by the doctor based on symptoms, risk factors, and existing diseases.
