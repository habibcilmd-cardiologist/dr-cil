faq:
    - question: "Is alcohol septal ablation painful?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and sedation. Temporary chest pain may be felt during alcohol injection, but this is controlled."
    - question: "Is a permanent pacemaker needed after ASA?"
      answer: "Approximately 10-15% of patients may require a permanent pacemaker. This risk is explained to the patient before the procedure."
    - question: "When is improvement seen after ASA?"
      answer: "Gradient reduction begins immediately, but septal thinning and full recovery takes 3-6 months."
    - question: "What is done if ASA fails?"
      answer: "In case of insufficient response, a second ASA or surgical myectomy may be considered."
    - question: "Can I exercise after ASA?"
      answer: "Competitive sports are generally not recommended in HOCM patients. Light to moderate exercise can be done under doctor supervision."

Alcohol septal ablation (ASA) is a minimally invasive interventional procedure used in the treatment of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM). In this procedure, alcohol is injected into the thickened septal muscle to create controlled damage and reduce left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

## What is Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy?

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a genetic disease characterized by abnormal thickening of the heart muscle. It is seen in approximately 1/500 of the general population.

**Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM):**

-   Seen in approximately 70% of HCM patients
-   Thickened septum narrows the left ventricular outflow tract
-   Blood flow is obstructed
-   Symptoms appear

## HOCM Symptoms

Symptoms of obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:

-   **Shortness of breath**: Especially with exertion
-   **Chest pain**: Angina-like
-   **Palpitations**: Due to arrhythmias
-   **Dizziness/fainting**: Especially with exertion
-   **Fatigue**: Limitation in daily activities

⚠️ **Important**: HOCM is one of the most common causes of sudden cardiac death in young athletes!

## Diagnosis

### Echocardiography

Primary imaging method in HOCM diagnosis:

-   Septal thickness (≥15 mm)
-   Left ventricular outflow tract gradient (≥30 mmHg)
-   Systolic anterior motion (SAM)
-   Mitral regurgitation

### Cardiac MRI

For detailed evaluation:

-   Myocardial thickness
-   Fibrosis (late gadolinium enhancement)
-   Sudden death risk assessment

### Genetic Testing

Genetic testing is recommended for family screening and risk assessment.

## Treatment Options

### Medical Treatment

First-line treatment:

-   Beta blockers
-   Calcium channel blockers (verapamil)
-   Disopyramide
-   Mavacamten (new generation)

### Septal Myectomy

Surgical treatment option:

-   Open heart surgery
-   Surgical removal of thickened septum
-   Gold standard (in experienced centers)

### Alcohol Septal Ablation (ASA)

Minimally invasive alternative:

-   Catheter-based procedure
-   Patients unsuitable for surgery
-   Equivalent long-term results

## How is Alcohol Septal Ablation Performed?

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

-   Comprehensive echocardiographic evaluation
-   Coronary angiography
-   Determination of septal artery anatomy
-   Temporary pacemaker placement

### Procedure Steps

1. **Coronary angiography**: Imaging of septal arteries
2. **Target artery selection**: Septal artery supplying the area causing obstruction
3. **Balloon placement**: Balloon catheter to selected septal artery
4. **Contrast echo**: Confirmation that balloon is in correct position
5. **Alcohol injection**: 1-3 ml pure alcohol injected slowly
6. **Waiting**: Balloon remains inflated for 5-10 minutes
7. **Control**: Gradient measurement and echocardiography

### Post-Procedure

-   Intensive care monitoring (24-48 hours)
-   Rhythm monitoring
-   Enzyme monitoring (troponin rises)
-   Temporary pacemaker (AV block risk)

## ASA Results

Expected results after successful ASA:

**Short Term:**

-   Gradient reduction (50-70%)
-   Symptom improvement
-   Increase in exercise capacity

**Long Term:**

-   Septal thinning (within 3-6 months)
-   Permanent gradient reduction
-   Significant improvement in quality of life

## ASA Risks and Complications

Procedure risks:

-   **AV block** (10-20%): May require permanent pacemaker
-   **Ventricular arrhythmia**: Rare
-   **Coronary artery damage**: Very rare
-   **Myocardial infarction**: Controlled (expected)
-   **Death**: <1%

## ASA or Myectomy?

Both treatments have advantages:

| Feature            | ASA            | Myectomy     |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------ |
| Invasiveness       | Minimal        | Open surgery |
| Anesthesia         | Local/sedation | General      |
| Recovery           | Fast           | Longer       |
| AV block risk      | Higher         | Lower        |
| Gradient reduction | Gradual        | Immediate    |
| Repeat procedure   | Possible       | Rare         |

The decision is made individually based on patient anatomy, age, and preference.
