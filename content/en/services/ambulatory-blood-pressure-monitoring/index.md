Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring (ABPM) is the continuous measurement of blood pressure over 24 hours. It is the gold standard method for diagnosing hypertension and monitoring treatment.

## What is Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring?

ABPM is a portable blood pressure measuring device. It automatically records blood pressure at regular intervals during daily activities and sleep.

**Advantages of ABPM:**

-   Continuous monitoring for 24 hours
-   Day and night blood pressure profile
-   Detection of white coat hypertension
-   Detection of masked hypertension
-   Evaluation of treatment efficacy

## ABPM Indications

### Hypertension Diagnosis

-   Suspected white coat hypertension
-   Suspected masked hypertension
-   Borderline high blood pressure values
-   Variable office blood pressure measurements

### Treatment Follow-up

-   Antihypertensive treatment efficacy
-   Medication dosage adjustment
-   Resistant hypertension evaluation
-   Hypotension symptoms

### Special Conditions

-   Pregnancy hypertension
-   Diabetic patients
-   Chronic kidney disease patients
-   Suspected sleep apnea
-   Target organ damage evaluation

## How is ABPM Performed?

### Preparation

-   No special preparation required
-   Comfortable, sleeveless or loose-sleeved clothing recommended
-   Normal daily activities can be continued

### Device Application

1. **Cuff placement**: Appropriately sized cuff is placed on the arm
2. **Device connection**: Recording device is attached to the waist
3. **Calibration**: Initial measurements are taken to check accuracy
4. **Diary provision**: For recording activities and symptoms

### Measurement Intervals

-   Daytime: Every 15-30 minutes
-   Nighttime: Every 30-60 minutes

## Evaluation of ABPM Results

### Normal Values

| Period | Systolic (mmHg) | Diastolic (mmHg) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| 24-hour average | <130 | <80 |
| Daytime average | <135 | <85 |
| Nighttime average | <120 | <70 |

### Parameters Evaluated

-   Average blood pressure values
-   Blood pressure variability
-   Nocturnal dipping
-   Morning surge
-   Blood pressure load

## Nocturnal Dipping Pattern

### Normal Dipping

-   Nighttime BP decreases 10-20% compared to daytime
-   Low cardiovascular risk

### Non-dipper

-   Nocturnal decline less than 10%
-   Increased cardiovascular risk
-   High risk of target organ damage

### Extreme Dipper

-   Nocturnal decline greater than 20%
-   Risk of nocturnal hypotension

### Reverse Dipper

-   Nighttime BP higher than daytime
-   Highest cardiovascular risk

## White Coat Hypertension

High in office, normal at home and on ABPM. ABPM is important to avoid unnecessary medication.

## Masked Hypertension

Normal in office, high in daily life. Carries risk of undiagnosed and untreated hypertension.

## ABPM in Treatment Follow-up

-   24-hour evaluation of medication efficacy
-   Dose adjustment decisions
-   Checking whether treatment goals are achieved
-   Side effect (hypotension) evaluation
