Surface echocardiography (transthoracic echocardiography - TTE) is a heart ultrasound examination performed through the chest wall. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in echocardiography evaluation.

## What is Surface Echocardiography?

Surface echocardiography is an imaging method that evaluates heart structure and function using ultrasound waves. It is a non-invasive and painless examination.

**Echocardiography Modes:**

-   2D (two-dimensional) imaging
-   M-mode
-   Doppler (color, pulsed, continuous)
-   Tissue Doppler

## Surface Echocardiography Indications

### Heart Failure

-   Ejection fraction evaluation
-   Diastolic function
-   Wall motion abnormalities

### Valve Diseases

-   Valve stenosis
-   Valve regurgitation
-   Prosthetic valve evaluation

### Coronary Artery Disease

-   Wall motion abnormalities
-   Myocardial infarction complications
-   Ventricular aneurysm

### Other Indications

-   Cardiomyopathy
-   Pericardial diseases
-   Congenital heart diseases
-   Endocarditis suspicion
-   Cardiac masses

## How is Echocardiography Performed?

### Preparation

-   No special preparation needed
-   Comfortable clothing recommended
-   Fasting not required

### Procedure Steps

1. **Position**: Left lateral decubitus
2. **Gel application**: On chest wall
3. **Probe placement**: From different windows
4. **Imaging**: 2D, M-mode, Doppler
5. **Measurements**: Standard measurements
6. **Recording**: Images and video

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 20-45 minutes

## Echocardiography Evaluation

### Left Ventricle

-   Ejection fraction (EF)
-   Wall thicknesses
-   Cavity dimensions
-   Wall motions

### Right Ventricle

-   TAPSE
-   Right ventricle size
-   Pulmonary pressure estimation

### Valves

-   Morphology
-   Stenosis degree
-   Regurgitation degree
-   Gradients

### Other Structures

-   Aortic root
-   Left atrium
-   Pericardium
-   Great vessels

## Normal Values

| Parameter   | Normal Value |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| EF          | 55-70%       |
| LV diastole | 35-56 mm     |
| LV systole  | 20-40 mm     |
| LA          | <40 mm       |
| Aortic root | <40 mm       |

## Echocardiography Advantages

-   Non-invasive
-   No radiation
-   Repeatable
-   Bedside applicable
-   Real-time imaging
