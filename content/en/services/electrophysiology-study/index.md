Electrophysiology study (EPS) is an invasive diagnostic procedure performed to evaluate the heart's electrical system. This procedure is used to determine the source of arrhythmias, perform risk assessment, and plan treatment. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in electrophysiology studies.

## What is an Electrophysiology Study?

EPS is the recording and stimulation of the heart's electrical activity through special catheters placed in the heart.

**What EPS Evaluates:**

-   Sinus node function
-   AV conduction system
-   His-Purkinje system
-   Inducibility of arrhythmias
-   Presence of accessory pathways

## EPS Indications

### Diagnostic Purposes

**Syncope Evaluation:**

-   Unexplained fainting
-   Structural heart disease + syncope
-   Family history of sudden death

**Arrhythmia Diagnosis:**

-   Palpitation complaints (not captured on ECG)
-   Wide QRS tachycardia (VT vs SVT differentiation)
-   Preexcitation syndromes

**Risk Assessment:**

-   Sudden cardiac death risk
-   ICD indication evaluation
-   Brugada syndrome

### Therapeutic Purposes

-   Pre-ablation mapping
-   Ablation procedure (in same session)

## How is EPS Performed?

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

-   Discontinuation of antiarrhythmic drugs (5 half-lives)
-   Fasting (6-8 hours)
-   Blood tests
-   Groin area shaving

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia + sedation
2. **Vascular access**: Femoral vein (groin)
3. **Catheter placement**: Under fluoroscopy guidance
    - High right atrium
    - His bundle
    - Coronary sinus
    - Right ventricular apex
4. **Baseline recordings**: Measurement of conduction times
5. **Programmed stimulation**: Induction of arrhythmias
6. **Mapping**: Determination of arrhythmia source (if needed)
7. **Catheter removal**: Hemostasis with pressure

### Procedure Duration

-   Diagnostic EPS: 1-2 hours
-   EPS + Ablation: 2-4 hours

## Parameters Measured in EPS

### Conduction Times

| Parameter        | Normal Value |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| PA interval      | 25-55 ms     |
| AH interval      | 55-125 ms    |
| HV interval      | 35-55 ms     |
| SNRT             | <1500 ms     |
| CSNRT            | <550 ms      |
| Wenckebach point | >500 ms      |

### Programmed Stimulation

-   Atrial stimulation (SVT induction)
-   Ventricular stimulation (VT induction)
-   Burst pacing
-   Extra stimulus protocols

## EPS Results

### Normal Findings

-   Normal conduction times
-   No arrhythmia inducibility
-   Normal sinus node function

### Abnormal Findings

-   Prolonged conduction times
-   Inducible arrhythmias
-   Presence of accessory pathway
-   Sinus node dysfunction

## EPS Risks

Procedure risks are low:

-   Access site complications (bleeding, hematoma)
-   Heart perforation (rare)
-   AV block (temporary or permanent)
-   Thromboembolism
-   Arrhythmia induction (in controlled environment)

## Post-Procedure Care

**In Hospital:**

-   4-6 hours bed rest
-   Access site monitoring
-   Rhythm monitoring

**After Discharge:**

-   Avoid heavy activity for 24-48 hours
-   Follow-up appointment for results evaluation

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is EPS painful?" >}}
The procedure is performed under local anesthesia and sedation. Mild discomfort may be felt during catheter placement.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How long does EPS take?" >}}
Diagnostic EPS usually takes 1-2 hours. If ablation is added, it may take 2-4 hours.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When can I go home after EPS?" >}}
Most patients are discharged the same day or the next day.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is it dangerous if arrhythmia is triggered during EPS?" >}}
Arrhythmias are triggered in a controlled environment and treated immediately if necessary. The team is prepared for all situations.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="What do EPS results mean?" >}}
Results help determine the arrhythmia type, source, and most appropriate treatment method.
