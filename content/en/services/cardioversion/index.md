faq:
    - question: "Is cardioversion painful?"
      answer: "Electrical cardioversion is performed under sedation, so no pain is felt. There may be mild chest discomfort when you wake up."
    - question: "How long does cardioversion take?"
      answer: "The procedure itself takes a few seconds. Including preparation and recovery, you stay in the hospital for 1-2 hours total."
    - question: "When can I return to work after cardioversion?"
      answer: "Most patients can return to normal activities the next day. You should not drive the same day due to sedation."
    - question: "Is cardioversion permanent?"
      answer: "Cardioversion corrects the rhythm but recurrence may occur. Treatment of underlying causes is important for long-term success."
    - question: "Do I need to take medication after cardioversion?"
      answer: "Yes, anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic medications are usually required. Duration and type are determined by the doctor."

Cardioversion is a treatment method applied to restore abnormal heart rhythm to normal sinus rhythm. It can be performed electrically or pharmacologically.

## What is Cardioversion?

Cardioversion is a controlled procedure applied to convert the heart's abnormal rhythm (usually atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter) to normal sinus rhythm.

**Types of Cardioversion:**

-   **Electrical cardioversion**: Controlled electric shock
-   **Pharmacological cardioversion**: Rhythm correction with medications

## Electrical Cardioversion

### How is it Performed?

1. **Preparation**: Fasting, anticoagulation check
2. **Sedation**: Short-term general anesthesia
3. **Electrode placement**: Adhesive electrodes on chest
4. **Shock delivery**: Shock synchronized with R wave
5. **Monitoring**: Rhythm and vital signs follow-up

### Energy Levels

| Arrhythmia          | Starting Energy      |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| Atrial fibrillation | 120-200 J (biphasic) |
| Atrial flutter      | 50-100 J             |
| SVT                 | 50-100 J             |
| VT (stable)         | 100-200 J            |

### Success Rates

-   Atrial fibrillation: 70-90%
-   Atrial flutter: >95%
-   Success depends on arrhythmia duration and underlying disease

## Pharmacological Cardioversion

### Medications Used

**Class IC Antiarrhythmics:**

-   Flecainide
-   Propafenone

**Class III Antiarrhythmics:**

-   Amiodarone
-   Ibutilide
-   Vernakalant

### Indications

-   New-onset AF (<48 hours)
-   If electrical cardioversion is contraindicated
-   Patient preference

## Cardioversion Indications

### Emergency Cardioversion

-   Hemodynamic instability
-   Acute heart failure
-   Myocardial ischemia
-   Hypotension

### Elective Cardioversion

-   Symptomatic AF/flutter
-   Inadequate rate control
-   Rhythm control strategy

## Pre-Cardioversion Preparation

### Anticoagulation

**AF >48 hours or unknown duration:**

-   At least 3 weeks of anticoagulation OR
-   TEE to rule out left atrial thrombus

**AF <48 hours:**

-   Anticoagulation with heparin is sufficient

### Other Preparations

-   Electrolyte check (especially potassium)
-   Digoxin level check
-   Thyroid function tests
-   Echocardiography

## Post-Cardioversion

### Immediately After

-   Rhythm monitoring
-   Vital signs follow-up
-   Waiting for sedation effect to wear off

### Long Term

-   Anticoagulation (at least 4 weeks)
-   Antiarrhythmic medication (recurrence prevention)
-   Regular check-ups

## Cardioversion Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Thromboembolism/stroke (if anticoagulation inadequate)
-   Skin burns (rare)
-   Bradycardia (temporary)
-   Other arrhythmias
-   Sedation complications

## Recurrence and Prevention

**Recurrence Rates:**

-   First year: 50-60%
-   With antiarrhythmic drugs: 30-40%

**Recurrence Prevention:**

-   Antiarrhythmic medications
-   Treatment of underlying causes
-   Lifestyle changes
-   Ablation (in recurrent cases)
