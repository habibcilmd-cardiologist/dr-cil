faq:
    - question: "Can coronary artery disease be completely cured?"
      answer: "Atherosclerosis is an irreversible process, but with appropriate treatment, disease progression can be stopped and in some cases plaques can even shrink. With lifestyle modifications and medication therapy, the vast majority of patients can continue their normal lives."
    - question: "How long should I take medication after stent placement?"
      answer: "Dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor) after stent typically lasts 6-12 months. Aspirin should be taken for life. Treatment duration is adjusted according to individual risk assessment."
    - question: "Can I return to normal life after stent placement?"
      answer: "Yes, most patients can return to normal activities within a few days after stent placement. Waiting 1-2 weeks is recommended for heavy physical activities. Cardiac rehabilitation program accelerates recovery."
    - question: "Can a stent become blocked again?"
      answer: "In modern drug-eluting stents, the restenosis rate is below 5%. However, medication adherence and control of risk factors further reduce this rate."
    - question: "Is bypass or stent better?"
      answer: 'Both treatments have advantages. The decision is made by the "Heart Team" considering the patient''s anatomy, comorbidities, and preferences.'

Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death from heart disease worldwide. This condition, which develops when the coronary arteries that supply the heart narrow or become blocked, affects millions of people every year. In Turkey, cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death, with coronary artery disease accounting for a large portion of these. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, this disease can be controlled and patients' quality of life can be significantly improved.

## What is Coronary Artery Disease?

Coronary artery disease is the narrowing or blockage of the coronary arteries that supply the heart muscle due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). In this process, fatty plaques accumulate on the vessel walls, and over time the vessel lumen narrows and blood flow decreases.

Atherosclerosis is a slowly progressing disease that often develops for years without symptoms. However, when the vessels narrow to a certain level or when plaque ruptures, serious consequences can occur:

-   **Stable angina**: Chest pain that occurs with exertion and resolves with rest
-   **Acute coronary syndrome**: Unstable angina or myocardial infarction (heart attack)
-   **Ischemic cardiomyopathy**: Weakening of the heart muscle due to chronic blood insufficiency
-   **Sudden cardiac death**: Fatal arrhythmia especially after plaque rupture

## Risk Factors

Many risk factors play a role in the development of coronary artery disease. Some of these can be modified, while others cannot.

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

-   **Age**: Over 45 in men, over 55 or post-menopause in women
-   **Gender**: Higher risk in men, but increases in women after menopause
-   **Family history**: Early coronary artery disease in first-degree relatives (male <55 years, female <65 years)
-   **Genetic factors**: Conditions such as familial hypercholesterolemia

### Modifiable Risk Factors

| Risk Factor           | Target Value                   |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Hypertension          | <130/80 mmHg                   |
| LDL cholesterol       | <70 mg/dL (high-risk patients) |
| HDL cholesterol       | Male >40, female >50 mg/dL     |
| Triglycerides         | <150 mg/dL                     |
| Fasting blood glucose | <100 mg/dL                     |
| HbA1c (diabetic)      | <7%                            |
| Body mass index       | 18.5-24.9 kg/m²                |
| Smoking               | Complete cessation             |

## Symptoms of Coronary Artery Disease

Coronary artery disease can present with different clinical pictures:

### Angina Pectoris (Chest Pain)

The most typical symptom is chest pain. Characteristic features:

-   Pressure or squeezing sensation in the center or left side of the chest
-   Triggered by exertion, stress, or cold weather
-   Lasts 2-10 minutes
-   Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin
-   May radiate to left arm, jaw, back, or stomach

### Atypical Symptoms

Especially in women, elderly, and diabetic patients:

-   Shortness of breath
-   Fatigue
-   Weakness
-   Stomach discomfort
-   Palpitations

### Silent Ischemia

In some patients, especially diabetic individuals, significant coronary narrowings may not cause any symptoms. This condition is called "silent ischemia" and emphasizes the importance of regular check-ups.

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis of coronary artery disease is done gradually according to the patient's risk profile and symptoms.

### Non-Invasive Tests

**Electrocardiography (ECG)**

-   Essential for initial evaluation
-   Resting and exercise ECG

**Exercise Stress Test (Treadmill Test)**

-   Evaluation of the heart during physical activity
-   Looking for ischemic findings

**Echocardiography**

-   Heart function and structural assessment
-   Regional wall motion abnormalities

**Stress Echocardiography**

-   Heart evaluation under stress with exercise or medication

**Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy**

-   Blood flow assessment with nuclear imaging
-   Distinction between viable tissue and scar

**Coronary CT Angiography**

-   Non-invasive imaging of coronary arteries
-   Preferred in low-moderate risk patients

### Invasive Diagnosis

**Coronary Angiography**

-   Gold standard diagnostic method
-   Direct visualization of vessel narrowings
-   Critical information for treatment planning

**FFR (Fractional Flow Reserve)**

-   Assessment of functional significance of narrowing
-   Guiding stent decision

## Our Treatment Approaches

Treatment of coronary artery disease is done with three basic approaches: lifestyle modifications, medical therapy, and revascularization (interventional or surgical).

### Lifestyle Modifications

Forms the foundation of all treatment strategies:

-   **Smoking cessation**: The most important step
-   **Heart-healthy diet**: Similar to Mediterranean diet
-   **Regular exercise**: 150 minutes per week at moderate intensity
-   **Weight control**: Ideal BMI target
-   **Stress management**: Psychological health is also important

### Medical Treatment

In coronary artery disease, medication therapy is used both to control symptoms and to slow disease progression:

**Anti-ischemic Medications:**

-   Beta-blockers (slows heart rate, reduces oxygen demand)
-   Nitrates (dilates vessels, relieves angina)
-   Calcium channel blockers (prevents vessel spasm)
-   Ranolazine (in refractory angina)

**Antithrombotic Therapy:**

-   Aspirin (in all patients)
-   P2Y12 inhibitors (clopidogrel, ticagrelor, prasugrel)
-   Dual antiplatelet therapy after stent

**Lipid-Lowering Therapy:**

-   Statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin) - cornerstone therapy
-   Ezetimibe (combination with statin)
-   PCSK9 inhibitors (very high-risk patients)

**Other Protective Medications:**

-   ACE inhibitors or ARBs
-   Diabetes treatment (SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 agonists)

### Interventional Treatment (Percutaneous Coronary Intervention - PCI)

Coronary angioplasty and stent placement is the most commonly used method for opening narrowed coronary arteries.

**How is the Procedure Performed?**

1. A catheter is inserted through the groin or wrist artery
2. Imaging is done by injecting contrast material into the coronary arteries
3. Balloon dilation is applied to the narrowed area
4. A stent (metal mesh) is placed to keep the vessel open

**Stent Types:**

-   Drug-eluting stents (DES): Standard choice today
-   Bare metal stents (BMS): In special situations
-   Bioresorbable stents: In selected cases

**PCI Indications:**

-   Acute coronary syndrome (heart attack)
-   Stable angina (symptoms despite medical therapy)
-   Functionally significant narrowings (FFR ≤0.80)

### Coronary Bypass Surgery (CABG)

In some patients, surgical treatment may be more appropriate:

-   Left main coronary artery disease
-   Three-vessel disease (especially in diabetic patients)
-   Multi-vessel disease with low ejection fraction
-   Anatomy not suitable for PCI

## Post-Treatment Follow-up

Coronary artery disease is a chronic condition requiring lifelong follow-up:

-   Regular cardiology check-ups (every 3-6 months)
-   Evaluation of medication adherence
-   Control of risk factors
-   Periodic imaging tests
-   Cardiac rehabilitation program
