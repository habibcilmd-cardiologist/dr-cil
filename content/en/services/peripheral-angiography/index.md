    - question: "What is peripheral angiography?"
      answer: "Peripheral angiography is the imaging of vessels outside the heart (legs, arms, abdomen, neck) using contrast dye and X-rays."
    - question: "When is peripheral angiography performed?"
      answer: "It is performed for leg pain, walking difficulty, foot ulcers, suspected renal artery disease, or stroke risk assessment."
    - question: "Is peripheral angiography painful?"
      answer: "It is performed under local anesthesia, so no pain is felt. A temporary warm sensation may occur when contrast is injected."
    - question: "How long does peripheral angiography take?"
      answer: "Diagnostic peripheral angiography typically takes 30-60 minutes. If treatment is added, it may take longer."
    - question: "When can I go home after peripheral angiography?"
      answer: "Discharge is usually possible the same day or the next day."

Peripheral angiography is the imaging of vessels outside the heart (arteries and veins) using X-rays and contrast dye. This procedure is used for diagnosing peripheral artery disease, venous diseases, and vascular anomalies.

## What is Peripheral Angiography?

Peripheral angiography is an invasive imaging method used to evaluate the internal structure and blood flow of all vessels outside the heart.

**Vessel Regions That Can Be Imaged:**

| Region | Arteries | Clinical Condition |
|--------|----------|-------------------|
| **Lower Extremity** | Iliac, femoral, popliteal, tibial | Leg pain, wounds |
| **Upper Extremity** | Subclavian, axillary, brachial | Arm pain, coldness |
| **Abdomen** | Aorta, mesenteric, renal | Kidney, intestine |
| **Neck** | Carotid, vertebral | Stroke risk |

## Indications for Peripheral Angiography

### Lower Extremity (Leg) Angiography

**Indications:**
- Leg pain while walking (claudication)
- Rest pain
- Non-healing foot wounds
- Diabetic foot
- Critical limb ischemia
- Acute arterial occlusion

### Upper Extremity (Arm) Angiography

**Indications:**
- Arm pain and coldness
- Subclavian steal syndrome
- Dialysis fistula evaluation
- Post-trauma evaluation

### Carotid and Vertebral Angiography

**Indications:**
- Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
- Stroke patients
- Carotid bruit
- Patients with stenosis on Doppler US

### Renal (Kidney) Angiography

**Indications:**
- Resistant hypertension
- Kidney function impairment
- Suspected renal artery stenosis
- Fibromuscular dysplasia

### Mesenteric Angiography

**Indications:**
- Chronic mesenteric ischemia
- Post-meal abdominal pain
- Weight loss
- Acute mesenteric ischemia

## Pre-Procedure Preparation

### Tests and Evaluations

- **Blood tests:** Kidney function (creatinine), coagulation tests
- **Doppler Ultrasound:** Initial assessment
- **CT Angiography:** Anatomical planning if needed
- **Allergy history:** Contrast allergy inquiry
- **Medication list:** Special attention to anticoagulants and antiplatelets

### Patient Preparation

- 6-8 hours fasting
- Metformin discontinuation (48 hours before)
- Anticoagulant adjustment
- Hydration (kidney protection)
- Consent form

## How is Peripheral Angiography Performed?

### Access Routes

**Femoral Access (Groin):**
- Most commonly used route
- Suitable for lower and upper extremity
- Antegrade or retrograde approach

**Radial/Brachial Access (Wrist/Arm):**
- Preferred for carotid angiography
- When femoral access is not suitable

**Popliteal Access (Behind Knee):**
- Special situations
- Retrograde tibial access

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia:** Applied to access site
2. **Vessel puncture:** Artery entered with needle
3. **Sheath placement:** For catheter passage
4. **Guidewire advancement:** Toward target vessel
5. **Catheter placement:** To area being imaged
6. **Contrast injection:** Serial images taken
7. **DSA (Digital Subtraction):** Bone image removed
8. **Hemostasis:** Catheter removed, pressure applied

### Procedure Duration

- **Diagnostic angiography:** 30-60 minutes
- **If treatment added:** 1-3 hours

## Angiography Findings

### Parameters Evaluated

- Stenosis degree and length
- Occlusion location
- Collateral vessels
- Plaque morphology
- Flow dynamics

### Stenosis Grading

| Grade | Stenosis (%) | Clinical Significance |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| Mild | <50% | Follow-up |
| Moderate | 50-70% | Symptom-based |
| Severe | 70-99% | Treatment needed |
| Occluded | 100% | Urgent evaluation |

## Treatment Options

During or after angiography:

### Same Session Treatment

- **Balloon angioplasty:** Dilation of stenosis
- **Stenting:** Permanent support
- **Atherectomy:** Plaque removal
- **Thrombolysis/Thrombectomy:** Clot dissolution/removal

### Next Steps

- **Medical treatment:** Antiplatelet, statin, exercise
- **Surgical bypass:** For unsuitable lesions
- **Hybrid approach:** Surgical + interventional

## Complications and Risks

Peripheral angiography is a safe procedure, but rare complications include:

### Access Site

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Hematoma | 2-5% | Pressure, observation |
| Pseudoaneurysm | 0.5-1% | US-guided compression |
| AV fistula | <0.5% | Surgical/interventional |
| Retroperitoneal bleeding | <0.5% | Transfusion, surgery |

### Systemic

- **Contrast nephropathy:** Prevented with hydration
- **Allergy:** Reduced with premedication
- **Embolization:** Rare, treatable
- **Dissection:** Prevented with careful technique

## Post-Procedure Care

### In Hospital

- 4-6 hours bed rest (femoral)
- 2-4 hours (radial)
- Vital signs monitoring
- Access site check
- Continued hydration

### After Discharge

- No heavy lifting for 24-48 hours
- Keep access site dry
- Regular medication use
- Seek care if symptoms develop
