    - question: "Does MPS contain radiation?"
      answer: "Yes, it contains low-dose radiation. However, its diagnostic benefit far outweighs the radiation risk."
    - question: "How long does MPS take?"
      answer: "Total duration is 3-4 hours in single-day protocol."
    - question: "Do I need to fast for MPS?"
      answer: "Yes, food should not be eaten 4 hours before the procedure."
    - question: "When do MPS results come out?"
      answer: "Results are usually reported within 1-2 days."
    - question: "Can MPS be done during pregnancy?"
      answer: "No, tests containing radiation are not performed during pregnancy."

Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (MPS) is a nuclear medicine imaging method that evaluates blood flow to the heart muscle. It has high accuracy in diagnosing coronary artery disease.

## What is Myocardial Perfusion Scintigraphy?

MPS images blood flow to the heart muscle using radioactive material (isotope). Ischemia or scar tissue is detected by comparing rest and stress images.

**Advantages of MPS:**

-   High diagnostic accuracy
-   Quantitative evaluation
-   Viability detection
-   Prognostic information

## MPS Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

-   Suspected coronary artery disease
-   Chest pain evaluation
-   Inconclusive stress test result
-   High-risk patients

### Prognostic Evaluation

-   Known coronary artery disease
-   Post-myocardial infarction
-   Pre/post-revascularization
-   Heart failure

### Viability Evaluation

-   Low ejection fraction
-   Before bypass surgery
-   Viable myocardium detection

## How is MPS Performed?

### Stress Protocol

**Exercise Stress:**

-   Treadmill or bicycle
-   Preferred method

**Pharmacological Stress:**

-   Adenosine or dipyridamole
-   For patients who cannot exercise

### Procedure Steps

1. **Stress application**: Exercise or medication
2. **Isotope injection**: At peak stress
3. **Stress imaging**: 15-30 minutes later
4. **Rest injection**: Separate day or same day
5. **Rest imaging**: For comparison

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 3-4 hours (single-day protocol)

## Pre-MPS Preparation

### General Preparation

-   4 hours fasting
-   Caffeine restriction (24 hours)
-   Comfortable clothing

### Medication Adjustment

-   Beta blockers (48 hours before)
-   Calcium channel blockers
-   Methylxanthines (theophylline)

## MPS Results

### Normal Findings

-   Homogeneous isotope uptake
-   Rest and stress images similar
-   No ischemia findings

### Abnormal Findings

| Finding              | Meaning         |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| Reversible defect    | Ischemia        |
| Fixed defect         | Scar/infarct    |
| Partially reversible | Ischemia + scar |
| Transient dilation   | Severe disease  |

## MPS Risks

Risks are low:

-   Radiation exposure (low dose)
-   Pharmacological stress side effects
-   Allergic reaction (rare)

## MPS vs Other Tests

| Test        | Advantage               | Disadvantage       |
| ----------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| MPS         | Quantitative, viability | Radiation          |
| Stress Echo | No radiation            | Operator dependent |
| Coronary CT | Anatomical imaging      | No functional info |
