faq:
    - question: "Does CRT cure heart failure?"
      answer: "CRT significantly reduces heart failure symptoms and improves quality of life. In some patients, heart function may return to near-normal levels."
    - question: "Is CRT implantation painful?"
      answer: "The procedure is performed under local anesthesia. No pain is felt during the procedure. There may be mild discomfort after the procedure."
    - question: "How long does a CRT battery last?"
      answer: "CRT batteries typically work for 5-8 years. When the battery runs out, only the generator is replaced."
    - question: "What if I don't respond to CRT?"
      answer: "Approximately 30% of patients may not respond adequately to CRT. In this case, optimization, electrode revision, or alternative treatments may be considered."
    - question: "Can I lead a normal life with CRT?"
      answer: "Yes, you can continue your normal daily activities with CRT. In fact, your exercise capacity may increase."

Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an advanced treatment method that ensures synchronized heart function in heart failure patients. Also known as a three-chamber pacemaker, CRT improves pumping function by stimulating both ventricles of the heart simultaneously. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in CRT implantation.

## What is CRT?

CRT is a special pacemaker that stimulates the left and right ventricles of the heart in a synchronized manner. Unlike regular pacemakers, it contains three electrodes:

1. **Right atrium electrode**: Stimulates the upper chamber of the heart
2. **Right ventricle electrode**: Stimulates the right lower chamber
3. **Left ventricle electrode**: Stimulates the left ventricle via the coronary sinus

## How Does CRT Work?

Left bundle branch block is frequently seen in heart failure. In this condition:

-   Left ventricle contracts with delay
-   Heart works inefficiently
-   Pumping power decreases

CRT, by stimulating both ventricles simultaneously:

-   Provides synchronized contraction
-   Increases pumping efficiency
-   Reduces heart failure symptoms

## Who is CRT Suitable For?

### Indications

**Definite Indications:**

-   Sinus rhythm + left bundle branch block (QRS ≥150 ms)
-   Ejection fraction ≤35%
-   NYHA class II-IV symptoms
-   Symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy

**Possible Indications:**

-   Wide QRS without left bundle branch block (≥150 ms)
-   Atrial fibrillation + low EF
-   Patients requiring high rate of ventricular pacing

### Types of CRT

**CRT-P (Pacemaker):**

-   Pacing function only
-   In patients with low sudden death risk

**CRT-D (Defibrillator):**

-   Pacing + defibrillation
-   In patients with high sudden death risk
-   Most commonly preferred type

## How is CRT Implantation Performed?

### Pre-Procedure Preparation

-   Echocardiography
-   ECG (QRS width measurement)
-   Coronary sinus anatomy evaluation
-   Blood tests
-   Anticoagulant adjustment

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: Local anesthesia + sedation
2. **Vascular access**: Subclavian vein
3. **Right atrium electrode**: Placement in right atrial appendage
4. **Right ventricle electrode**: Placement in right ventricular apex
5. **Left ventricle electrode**: Placement via coronary sinus (most critical step)
6. **Testing**: Verification of electrode function
7. **Generator connection**: Connecting electrodes to device
8. **Closure**: Skin closed with sutures

### Procedure Duration

CRT implantation usually takes 2-3 hours (depending on left ventricle electrode placement difficulty).

## CRT Results

Expected improvements after successful CRT:

**Short Term:**

-   Reduction in shortness of breath
-   Increase in exercise capacity
-   Improvement in quality of life

**Long Term:**

-   Increase in ejection fraction
-   Reduction in heart size (reverse remodeling)
-   Decrease in hospitalization rate
-   Survival advantage

**Response Rates:**

-   Approximately 70% of patients respond to CRT
-   30% may be "super responders" (EF normalizes)

## CRT Risks

Procedure risks:

-   Coronary sinus dissection
-   Left ventricle electrode placement failure (5-10%)
-   Phrenic nerve stimulation (diaphragm contraction)
-   Infection
-   Pneumothorax
-   Electrode dislocation

## CRT Optimization

Optimization may be needed for CRT to provide maximum benefit:

-   AV delay adjustment
-   VV delay adjustment
-   Echocardiography-guided programming
