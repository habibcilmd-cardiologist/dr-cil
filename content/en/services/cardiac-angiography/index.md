Cardiac angiography is evaluation of heart vessels using X-ray imaging. It is the gold standard method for diagnosing coronary artery disease. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in cardiac angiography procedures.

## What is Cardiac Angiography?

Cardiac angiography is imaging of heart vessels using contrast material. Stenosis, occlusion, and anomalies in coronary arteries are detected.

**Purposes of Cardiac Angiography:**

-   Coronary artery disease diagnosis
-   Determining stenosis degree
-   Treatment planning
-   Intervention decision

## Cardiac Angiography Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

-   Stable angina pectoris
-   Acute coronary syndrome
-   Positive stress test
-   Heart failure evaluation

### Interventional Indications

-   Stent planning
-   Before bypass surgery
-   Before valve surgery
-   Structural heart disease

## Pre-Cardiac Angiography Preparation

### Patient Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Kidney function tests
-   Blood thinner adjustment
-   Allergy history inquiry

### Contraindications

-   Severe kidney failure
-   Contrast allergy
-   Active infection
-   Uncontrolled hypertension

## How is Cardiac Angiography Performed?

### Access Routes

**Femoral Approach:**

-   Groin access
-   Classic method
-   Large catheters can be used

**Radial Approach:**

-   Wrist access
-   Fewer complications
-   Early mobilization

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: To access site
2. **Artery puncture**: Femoral or radial
3. **Guidewire advancement**: To aorta
4. **Catheter placement**: To coronary ostia
5. **Contrast injection**: For imaging
6. **Image recording**: From different angles
7. **Catheter removal**: End of procedure
8. **Hemostasis**: Bleeding control

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 15-30 minutes

## Cardiac Angiography Results

### Normal Findings

-   Smooth coronary arteries
-   No stenosis
-   Normal flow

### Pathological Findings

-   Coronary stenosis
-   Total occlusion
-   Aneurysm
-   Anomaly

### Stenosis Grading

| Grade    | Stenosis Rate |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Mild     | <50%          |
| Moderate | 50-70%        |
| Severe   | 70-90%        |
| Critical | >90%          |

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is cardiac angiography painful?" >}}
It is performed under local anesthesia and usually no pain is felt. Only temporary warmth sensation may occur during contrast injection.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How long is hospital stay after angiography?" >}}
With radial approach, same-day discharge is usually possible. Femoral approach requires 4-6 hours bed rest.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="What are the risks of angiography?" >}}
Serious complications are rare. Bleeding, infection, and contrast reaction may occur.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When can I return to normal activity after angiography?" >}}
With radial approach 1-2 days, with femoral approach 3-5 days after normal activities can be resumed.
