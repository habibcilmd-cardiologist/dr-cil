    - question: "What is cardiovascular prevention?"
      answer: "It encompasses all medical and lifestyle interventions aimed at preventing the onset of cardiovascular diseases (primary prevention) or halting progression and preventing new events in established disease (secondary prevention)."
    - question: "How is cardiovascular risk calculated?"
      answer: "Physicians use scoring systems like SCORE2, Framingham, or ASCVD. Data such as age, gender, smoking status, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure are used in this calculation."
    - question: "Who should undergo cardiovascular risk assessment?"
      answer: "It is recommended for all individuals over 40, and younger individuals with a family history of premature heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, or obesity."
    - question: "Which medications are used in preventive therapy?"
      answer: "Depending on the risk level, blood thinners (aspirin, etc.), lipid-lowering drugs (statins), and antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors, etc.) may be used under physician supervision."
    - question: "Are diet and exercise alone enough to prevent heart disease?"
      answer: "Lifestyle changes are very effective in low and moderate-risk individuals. However, in the presence of high genetic risk or advanced atherosclerosis, medical treatment is often necessary."
    - question: "How does stress affect heart health?"
      answer: "Chronic stress can raise blood pressure and trigger inflammation by increasing adrenaline and cortisol hormones. Stress management is a crucial part of cardiovascular prevention."
    - question: "How much does quitting smoking reduce risk?"
      answer: "Risk of heart disease drops by 50% within 1 year of quitting smoking. In the long term, it can approach the level of a non-smoker."
    - question: "Is alcohol consumption risky for heart health?"
      answer: "Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to hypertension, arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation), and heart muscle disease (cardiomyopathy). Limited or no consumption is recommended."

**Cardiovascular Diseases** unfortunately rank first among causes of death globally. However, the encouraging news is that a significant portion of these diseases is **preventable**. **Cardiovascular Prevention (Preventive Cardiology)** is one of the most important fields of medicine, aiming to identify and eliminate risk factors before diseases develop or to increase life expectancy and quality in individuals with established disease.

## What is Cardiovascular Prevention?

Cardiovascular prevention is not a single procedure or medication, but a **holistic approach to lifestyle and medicine**. It is examined under two main headings:

1.  **Primary Prevention:** Aimed at preventing the disease from ever occurring in individuals who have not yet been clinically diagnosed with heart or vascular disease but carry risk factors. (e.g., treating a smoker with high blood pressure who does not yet have arterial blockage).
2.  **Secondary Prevention:** Aimed at stopping disease progression and preventing the development of a new event (recurrence) in patients who have previously had a heart attack, stroke, stent placement, or bypass surgery.

## Who is at Risk?

The process of atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) begins in childhood and progresses silently for many years. If you have one or more of the following factors, cardiovascular risk assessment is recommended:

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors
*   **Age:** Being over 45 for men and over 55 for women increases risk.
*   **Gender:** Risk generally begins at earlier ages in men. However, women's risk approaches that of men after menopause.
*   **Family History (Genetics):** Having a history of heart attack or sudden death at a young age (men <55, women <65) in first-degree relatives (mother, father, siblings) is a strong risk factor.

### Modifiable Risk Factors
*   **Smoking:** The most significant preventable cause of death.
*   **Hypertension (High Blood Pressure):** Uncontrolled blood pressure damages the inner vessel wall.
*   **Hyperlipidemia (High Cholesterol):** High LDL and low HDL pave the way for arterial blockage.
*   **Diabetes:** Diabetic patients are considered a high-risk group for heart disease.
*   **Obesity and Overweight:** Fat accumulation, especially around the abdomen, is an indicator of metabolic syndrome.
*   **Physical Inactivity:** Sedentary lifestyle.
*   **Unhealthy Diet:** Consumption of processed foods, excessive salt, and saturated fats.
*   **Stress and Psychosocial Factors:** Depression, anxiety, and social isolation.

## How is Cardiovascular Risk Assessment Performed?

With a detailed evaluation performed in the cardiology clinic, your "Heart Age" and your risk of having a heart attack or stroke within the next 10 years can be calculated.

### 1. Detailed History and Physical Examination
The patient's complaints, medical history, and family history are questioned. Blood pressure is measured from both arms, and pulse and heart auscultation (listening) are performed.

### 2. Laboratory Tests
*   **Lipid Profile:** Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides.
*   **Fasting Blood Glucose and HbA1c:** For diabetes screening.
*   **Kidney Function Tests:** Creatinine, eGFR.
*   **hs-CRP:** A sensitive marker indicating the level of inflammation in the body, used to determine atherosclerosis risk.
*   **Lipoprotein(a):** A specific blood fat parameter used to determine genetic risk.

### 3. Advanced Diagnostic Methods (When Necessary)
*   **EKG (Electrocardiography):** Evaluates heart rhythm and electrical activity.
*   **Stress Test:** Checks the heart's blood supply during exercise.
*   **Echocardiography:** Examines heart valves and contraction strength.
*   **Carotid Doppler:** Thickening in the neck artery can be an indicator of general atherosclerosis in the body.
*   **Coronary Calcium Score (CT):** Determines risk level by measuring the calcification rate in heart vessels.

## Cardiovascular Prevention Strategies

After risk analysis, a personalized "Road Map" is determined. This map consists of three basic steps.

### Step 1: Lifestyle Changes (The Most Important Step)

*   **Smoking Cessation:** The single most effective intervention in reducing cardiovascular risk.
*   **Healthy Diet (Mediterranean Diet):** A diet rich in vegetables, fruits, legumes, fish, and olive oil. Limiting salt consumption to 5 grams (1 teaspoon) per day.
*   **Regular Exercise:** At least 150 minutes of moderate-paced walking or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise per week.
*   **Weight Control:** Maintaining Body Mass Index (BMI) in the 20-25 range and reducing waist circumference (Men <94cm, Women <80cm).

### Step 2: Medical Management of Risk Factors

In cases where lifestyle changes are insufficient, medication therapies are applied under physician supervision.

*   **Hypertension Control:** Target blood pressure is generally below 130/80 mmHg (may vary based on patient age and comorbidities).
*   **Lipid Management:** LDL cholesterol targets are determined according to the individual's risk group (e.g., LDL < 55 mg/dL in very high-risk patients). Statins are the most commonly used drugs for this.
*   **Diabetes Management:** Strict control of blood sugar and use of new generation diabetes medications with proven cardiovascular protective effects.

### Step 3: Preventive Pharmacotherapy

*   **Antiplatelet (Blood Thinner) Therapy:** Vital especially in patients who have had stents or heart attacks (secondary prevention). In primary prevention (when no disease is present), its use is controversial and considered only in very high-risk patients by physician decision.

## Why Regular Check-ups?

Cardiovascular diseases often progress silently. You may not feel it when your blood pressure rises or your cholesterol increases. Therefore, even if you have no complaints:

*   **From age 40:** Annual heart health check-up.
*   **If you are in a high-risk group:** Follow-up at more frequent intervals (every 3-6 months) as determined by your physician is recommended.
