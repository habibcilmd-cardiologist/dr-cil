faq:
    - question: "What is the difference between PTCA and stent?"
      answer: "PTCA is only dilation with balloon, stent is placement of permanent metal mesh."
    - question: "Does the vessel narrow again after PTCA?"
      answer: "Restenosis rate with PTCA alone is 30-40%. With stent, this rate drops to 5-10%."
    - question: "Is PTCA painful?"
      answer: "It is performed under local anesthesia. Temporary chest pain may occur during balloon inflation."
    - question: "How long does PTCA take?"
      answer: "The procedure usually takes 15-60 minutes."
    - question: "When will I be discharged after PTCA?"
      answer: "Usually same day or next day discharge is possible."

PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) is dilation of coronary artery stenosis with balloon. It forms the basis of modern coronary interventions. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in PTCA procedures.

## What is PTCA?

PTCA is dilation of coronary artery stenosis with a balloon at the catheter tip. It was first performed by Andreas Grüntzig in 1977.

**History of PTCA:**

-   1977: First PTCA
-   1986: First stent
-   1990s: Drug-eluting stents
-   Today: Modern PCI

## PTCA Indications

### PTCA Alone

-   Small vessels
-   Situations where stent placement is difficult
-   Temporary treatment

### PTCA Before Stent

-   Predilation
-   Lesion preparation
-   For stent passage

### PTCA After Stent

-   Postdilation
-   Optimal expansion
-   Malapposition correction

## How is PTCA Performed?

### Balloon Types

**Semi-Compliant Balloon:**

-   For predilation
-   Flexible structure
-   Low pressure

**Non-Compliant Balloon:**

-   For postdilation
-   High pressure
-   Stent expansion

**Cutting Balloon:**

-   Calcified lesions
-   In-stent restenosis
-   Fibrotic lesions

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Radial or femoral
2. **Guide catheter**: To coronary ostium
3. **Guidewire**: Crossing lesion
4. **Balloon placement**: Over lesion
5. **Balloon inflation**: At specific pressure
6. **Balloon deflation**: Result evaluation
7. **Re-inflation**: If needed

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 15-60 minutes

## PTCA Results

### Success Criteria

-   Residual stenosis <50%
-   TIMI 3 flow
-   No dissection
-   No complications

### Complications

-   Dissection
-   Acute occlusion
-   Perforation
-   Spasm
-   Slow flow

## PTCA vs Stent

| Feature         | PTCA       | Stent     |
| --------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| Restenosis      | 30-40%     | 5-10%     |
| Acute occlusion | Higher     | Lower     |
| Antiplatelet    | Short-term | Long-term |
| Cost            | Lower      | Higher    |

## PTCA Today

In modern practice, PTCA is usually performed together with stent implantation. PTCA alone is preferred in rare situations.

**Indications for PTCA Alone:**

-   Very small vessels (<2mm)
-   Situations where stent placement is technically difficult
-   Temporary bridge therapy
