Holter monitoring is the continuous recording of the heart's electrical activity for 24-48 hours or longer. It is the gold standard method for detecting intermittent rhythm disorders. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in Holter evaluation.

## What is Holter Monitoring?

A Holter is a portable ECG recording device. It continuously records heart rhythm during daily activities. This allows detection of rhythm disorders that cannot be captured on short-term ECG.

**Advantages of Holter:**

-   Continuous recording
-   Monitoring during daily activities
-   Symptom-rhythm correlation
-   Detection of intermittent arrhythmias

## Holter Indications

### Symptom Evaluation

-   Palpitations
-   Dizziness
-   Fainting (syncope)
-   Presyncope
-   Unexplained fatigue

### Arrhythmia Diagnosis and Follow-up

-   Suspected atrial fibrillation
-   Supraventricular tachycardia
-   Ventricular arrhythmia
-   Bradycardia
-   Pacemaker function check

### Other Indications

-   AF screening after stroke
-   Antiarrhythmic drug efficacy
-   Post-ablation follow-up
-   Arrhythmia screening in heart failure

## Types of Holter

### 24-Hour Holter

-   Most commonly used
-   Covers daily activities
-   Evaluates day and night rhythm

### 48-72 Hour Holter

-   Longer recording duration
-   Detection of rare arrhythmias
-   Higher diagnostic yield

### Event Recorder

-   Worn for 2-4 weeks
-   Records at time of symptoms
-   For very rare arrhythmias

### Implantable Loop Recorder

-   Placed under the skin
-   Records up to 3 years
-   For unexplained syncope

## How is Holter Applied?

### Preparation

-   No special preparation required
-   Chest area should be clean
-   Comfortable clothing preferred

### Application Process

1. **Skin preparation**: Cleaning and shaving
2. **Electrode placement**: 5-7 electrodes
3. **Device connection**: Hung on waist or shoulder
4. **Patient education**: Keeping a diary

### Recording Duration

-   Standard: 24 hours
-   Extended: 48-72 hours
-   Event recorder: 2-4 weeks

## Precautions During Holter

-   Continue normal daily activities
-   Keep a symptom diary
-   Note activity times
-   Keep device dry

### Things to Avoid

-   Shower or bath
-   Touching electrodes
-   Magnetic fields
-   Excessive sweating

## Holter Results

### Evaluated Parameters

| Parameter            | Description             |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Total beat count     | ~100,000 in 24 hours    |
| Average heart rate   | Day/night separate      |
| Minimum/maximum rate | Bradycardia/tachycardia |
| Arrhythmia count     | PAC, PVC, others        |
| ST changes           | Ischemia findings       |

### Common Findings

-   Sinus arrhythmia (normal variant)
-   Premature atrial complexes (PAC)
-   Premature ventricular complexes (PVC)
-   Atrial fibrillation episodes
-   Supraventricular tachycardia
