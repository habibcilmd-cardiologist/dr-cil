MitraClip is catheter-based treatment of severe mitral regurgitation. It is a minimally invasive alternative to open heart surgery. Interventional cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in MitraClip procedures.

## What is MitraClip?

MitraClip is a small clip that holds the mitral valve leaflets together. It is delivered to the heart via the femoral vein and reduces mitral regurgitation.

**Advantages of MitraClip:**

-   No open heart surgery required
-   Minimally invasive
-   Rapid recovery
-   Can be performed in high-risk patients

## MitraClip Indications

### Primary Mitral Regurgitation

-   Severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation
-   High surgical risk
-   Suitable valve anatomy

### Secondary Mitral Regurgitation

-   Functional mitral regurgitation
-   With heart failure
-   Symptoms despite optimal medical therapy

### Patient Selection

-   STS score ≥8% or
-   High-risk assessment by heart team
-   Suitable anatomical criteria

## Pre-MitraClip Evaluation

### Imaging

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Transesophageal echocardiography (3D)
-   Cardiac CT (if needed)

### Anatomical Criteria

-   Adequate leaflet length
-   Coaptation depth
-   Flail width
-   Calcification status

### Additional Evaluations

-   Coronary angiography
-   Right heart catheterization
-   Kidney function
-   General condition assessment

## How is MitraClip Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **Anesthesia**: General anesthesia
2. **Femoral vein access**: Right groin
3. **Transseptal puncture**: Access to left atrium
4. **Guide catheter**: Placement in left atrium
5. **MitraClip advancement**: To mitral valve
6. **Leaflet capture**: Both leaflets
7. **Clip release**: After result evaluation
8. **Additional clip**: If needed

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 2-4 hours

### TEE Guidance

Transesophageal echocardiography imaging is performed throughout the procedure.

## MitraClip Results

### Success Criteria

-   Reduction in mitral regurgitation (≤2+)
-   Symptom improvement
-   Functional capacity increase
-   Reduction in hospitalizations

### Clinical Outcomes

-   80-90% procedural success
-   Symptom improvement
-   Quality of life improvement
-   Survival benefit (in secondary MR)

## MitraClip Complications

Complications are rare:

-   Clip detachment
-   Mitral stenosis
-   Vascular complications
-   Atrial septal defect

## Post-MitraClip Care

### Hospital Follow-up

-   1-3 days hospital stay
-   Echocardiography control
-   Early mobilization

### After Discharge

-   Anticoagulation (if needed)
-   Regular echocardiography
-   Heart failure treatment optimization
