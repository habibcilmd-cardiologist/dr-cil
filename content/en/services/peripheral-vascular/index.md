    - question: "Is blockage in leg arteries dangerous?"
      answer: "Yes, if untreated, it can progress to critical limb ischemia and gangrene. These complications can be prevented with early diagnosis and treatment."
    - question: "Can I walk after peripheral angioplasty?"
      answer: "Yes, most patients can walk the same day or the next day after the procedure. Walking distance usually increases significantly."
    - question: "Can stents be placed in leg arteries?"
      answer: "Yes, stents are frequently used especially in iliac and femoral arteries. Balloon angioplasty is generally preferred for below-knee vessels."
    - question: "Is peripheral vascular disease related to heart disease?"
      answer: "Yes, most patients with PAD also have coronary artery disease. Therefore, comprehensive cardiovascular evaluation is important."
    - question: "Does quitting smoking help treatment?"
      answer: "Absolutely. Smoking cessation is the most important component of PAD treatment. It slows disease progression and increases treatment success."

Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is the narrowing or blockage of arteries outside the heart and brain due to atherosclerosis. This disease, which most commonly affects leg arteries, can lead to serious consequences from walking difficulty to gangrene.

## What is Peripheral Artery Disease?

Peripheral artery disease is the narrowing or blockage of arteries supplying the extremities (especially legs) due to atherosclerosis. It shares the same risk factors as coronary artery disease and is often seen together.

PAD affects more than 200 million people worldwide. It is seen in approximately 20% of the population over 65 years of age.

## Symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease

### Classic Symptoms

**Intermittent Claudication:**

-   Pain, cramping, or fatigue in legs while walking
-   Resolves with rest
-   Occurs after a certain distance
-   Most common in calf muscles

**Critical Limb Ischemia:**

-   Rest pain (especially at night)
-   Coldness and color change in feet
-   Non-healing wounds
-   Risk of gangrene

### Fontaine Classification

| Stage | Symptom                               |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- |
| I     | Asymptomatic                          |
| IIa   | Mild claudication (>200 m)            |
| IIb   | Moderate-severe claudication (<200 m) |
| III   | Rest pain                             |
| IV    | Ulcer or gangrene                     |

## Risk Factors

Main risk factors for PAD:

-   **Smoking**: Most important risk factor
-   **Diabetes**: Increases risk 2-4 times
-   **Hypertension**
-   **Hyperlipidemia**
-   **Advanced age**
-   **Chronic kidney disease**
-   **History of coronary artery disease**

## Diagnostic Methods

### Non-Invasive Tests

**Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI):**

-   Simple and reliable screening test
-   ABI <0.9: PAD diagnosis
-   ABI <0.4: Critical ischemia

**Doppler Ultrasonography:**

-   Vessel structure and flow assessment
-   Location and degree of narrowing

**CT Angiography:**

-   Detailed anatomical imaging
-   For treatment planning

**MR Angiography:**

-   Imaging without contrast material
-   Preferred in kidney failure

### Invasive Diagnosis

**Peripheral Angiography:**

-   Gold standard
-   Can be done simultaneously with treatment

## Our Treatment Approaches

### Medical Treatment

Basic treatment in all PAD patients:

-   **Antiplatelet therapy**: Aspirin or clopidogrel
-   **Statin therapy**: LDL target <70 mg/dL
-   **Hypertension control**
-   **Diabetes management**
-   **Smoking cessation**: Absolute necessity
-   **Exercise program**: Increases walking distance

### Endovascular Treatment

Minimally invasive interventional treatment options:

**Balloon Angioplasty:**

-   Widening of narrowed vessel with balloon
-   Drug-coated balloons (DCB) reduce restenosis rate

**Stent Placement:**

-   Keeps the vessel open
-   Drug-eluting stents are preferred

**Atherectomy:**

-   Mechanical removal of plaque
-   Effective in calcified lesions

**Chronic Total Occlusion Opening:**

-   Opening of completely blocked vessels
-   Requires special techniques

### Surgical Treatment

In cases not suitable for endovascular treatment:

-   Bypass surgery
-   Endarterectomy
-   Amputation (last resort)

## Treatment Areas

Peripheral vascular interventions are performed in different anatomical regions:

**Lower Extremity:**

-   Iliac arteries
-   Femoral arteries
-   Popliteal artery
-   Tibial arteries
-   Foot arteries

**Renal Arteries:**

-   Renovascular hypertension
-   Ischemic nephropathy

**Subclavian Artery:**

-   Arm ischemia
-   Subclavian steal syndrome

## Post-Procedure Care

After peripheral intervention:

**In Hospital:**

-   Access site monitoring
-   Pulse check
-   Hydration

**After Discharge:**

-   Antiplatelet therapy
-   Statin therapy
-   Regular exercise
-   Risk factor control
-   Periodic check-ups
