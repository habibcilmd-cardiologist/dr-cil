    - question: "What is mitral balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Mitral balloon valvuloplasty is a procedure to widen a narrowed mitral valve using a balloon catheter. It is a minimally invasive treatment that does not require open heart surgery."
    - question: "Who is a candidate for mitral balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Patients with symptomatic mitral stenosis, suitable valve anatomy, and no significant mitral regurgitation are candidates. It is especially preferred for rheumatic mitral stenosis."
    - question: "How long is recovery after mitral balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Hospital stay is typically 1-2 days. Most patients return to normal activities within 1 week."
    - question: "Is mitral balloon valvuloplasty permanent?"
      answer: "Yes, in suitable patients it provides long-lasting results. Many patients remain restenosis-free for 10-20 years, though some may need repeat procedure years later."
    - question: "What are the risks of mitral balloon valvuloplasty?"
      answer: "Severe mitral regurgitation (1-2%), cardiac tamponade (<1%), and embolism are rare complications. It is a safe procedure in experienced centers."

Mitral balloon valvuloplasty (PMBV - Percutaneous Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty) is the catheter-based treatment of mitral valve stenosis. This method, particularly effective for rheumatic mitral stenosis, is a minimally invasive alternative to open heart surgery.

## What is Mitral Valve Stenosis?

The mitral valve is located between the left atrium and left ventricle. Mitral stenosis is the narrowing of this valve, making it difficult for blood to flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle.

### Causes of Mitral Stenosis

| Cause | Description | Frequency |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Rheumatic** | Previous rheumatic fever | Most common (90%) |
| **Degenerative** | Age-related calcification | Rare |
| **Congenital** | Birth defect | Very rare |
| **SLE/RA** | Autoimmune diseases | Rare |

### Symptoms of Mitral Stenosis

- Shortness of breath (especially with exertion)
- Palpitations (atrial fibrillation)
- Fatigue
- Ankle swelling
- Chest pressure
- Blood-tinged sputum (advanced stage)

## What is Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty?

PMBV is the procedure of dilating the mitral valve using a special balloon catheter inserted through the femoral vein. Developed by Dr. Kanji Inoue in 1984, this technique has become the standard treatment worldwide.

### Advantages of the Procedure

- ✅ No open heart surgery required
- ✅ May not require general anesthesia
- ✅ Completed in 1-2 hours
- ✅ 1-2 day hospital stay
- ✅ Quick recovery
- ✅ Repeatable
- ✅ Safe during pregnancy

## Who is Suitable for PMBV?

### Indications

**Absolute Indications:**
- Symptomatic moderate-severe mitral stenosis (MVA ≤1.5 cm²)
- Suitable valve anatomy (Wilkins score ≤8)
- No significant mitral regurgitation (≤2+)
- No thrombus in left atrium

**Relative Indications:**
- Asymptomatic severe mitral stenosis + pulmonary hypertension
- Pregnant patients
- High surgical risk patients
- NYHA class III-IV symptoms

### Contraindications

- Severe mitral regurgitation (≥3+)
- Left atrial thrombus
- Severe bicommissural calcification
- Severe aortic valve disease
- Active endocarditis

## Wilkins Score - Valve Suitability

A scoring system used to assess valve anatomy suitability:

| Parameter | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|-----------|---|---|---|---|
| **Mobility** | Good | Moderate | Limited | Very limited |
| **Thickening** | Minimal | Tip thickening | Widespread | Severe |
| **Calcification** | None | Mild | Moderate | Extensive |
| **Subvalvular** | Normal | Mild | Moderate | Severe |

**Assessment:**
- **Total ≤8**: Excellent candidate ✅
- **Total 9-11**: Acceptable candidate
- **Total ≥12**: Not suitable for PMBV ❌

## Pre-Procedure Preparation

### Evaluation

1. **Transthoracic Echocardiography (TTE)**
   - Valve area measurement
   - Wilkins score
   - Mitral regurgitation degree
   - Pulmonary pressure

2. **Transesophageal Echocardiography (TEE)**
   - Left atrial thrombus screening
   - Detailed valve anatomy
   - On procedure day or 24-48 hours before

3. **Laboratory Tests**
   - Complete blood count
   - Coagulation tests
   - Kidney function
   - Thyroid function

## Procedure Technique

### Step-by-Step PMBV

**1. Vascular Access**
- Right femoral vein puncture
- Guidewire placement

**2. Transseptal Puncture**
- Passage from right atrium to left atrium
- Needle puncture through fossa ovalis
- Critical step requiring experience

**3. Left Atrial Entry**
- Dilator and sheath placement
- Anticoagulation (heparin)

**4. Balloon Catheter Placement**
- Inoue balloon advanced into left atrium
- Passed through mitral valve orifice

**5. Balloon Inflation**
- Stepwise inflation technique
- Distal portion first, then proximal
- Separation of valve commissures

**6. Result Assessment**
- Pressure measurements
- Echocardiographic control
- Mitral regurgitation evaluation

## Success Criteria

### Optimal Outcome

| Parameter | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Mitral valve area | ≥1.5 cm² or 50% increase |
| Mean gradient | ≤5 mmHg |
| Mitral regurgitation | ≤2+ |
| Complications | None |

### Success Rates

- **Procedural success**: 95-98%
- **10-year restenosis-free survival**: 60-80%
- **15-year restenosis-free survival**: 40-60%

## Complications and Management

### Early Complications

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Severe mitral regurgitation | 1-2% | Emergency surgery |
| Cardiac tamponade | <1% | Pericardiocentesis |
| Systemic embolism | <1% | Anticoagulation |
| Atrial septal defect | 5-10% | Most close spontaneously |
| Vascular complication | 2-3% | Local repair |

### Late Complications

- **Restenosis**: 2-4% per year
- **Atrial fibrillation**: Requires follow-up and treatment

## Post-Procedure Follow-up

### In Hospital

- 24 hours bed rest
- ECG and hemodynamic monitoring
- Control echocardiography
- Discharge in 1-2 days

### After Discharge

**Medication:**
- Aspirin (short-term)
- Anticoagulant for atrial fibrillation
- Diuretic (if needed)

**Follow-up Schedule:**
- 1 week: Clinical check
- 1 month: Echocardiography
- 6 months: Echocardiography
- Then annual follow-up
