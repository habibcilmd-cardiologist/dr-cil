faq:
    - question: "Is cardiac CT painful?"
      answer: "No, only IV contrast injection is done. It is a painless procedure."
    - question: "How long does cardiac CT take?"
      answer: "Total procedure duration is 15-30 minutes."
    - question: "Does cardiac CT contain radiation?"
      answer: "Yes, it contains low-dose radiation. Dose is minimized with modern devices."
    - question: "Can cardiac CT replace angiography?"
      answer: "In low-intermediate risk patients, yes. Invasive angiography may be needed in high-risk patients."
    - question: "When do cardiac CT results come out?"
      answer: "Results are usually reported the same day or next day."

Cardiac CT (Computed Tomography) is non-invasive imaging of the heart and coronary arteries. It has an important place in screening and evaluating coronary artery disease.

## What is Cardiac CT?

Cardiac CT uses X-rays to create detailed cross-sectional images of the heart and coronary arteries. When used with contrast material, the internal structure of coronary arteries can be visualized.

**Types of Cardiac CT:**

-   Coronary CT Angiography (CCTA)
-   Calcium Scoring
-   Cardiac CT (structural evaluation)

## Coronary CT Angiography Indications

### Low-Intermediate Risk Patients

-   Atypical chest pain
-   Inconclusive stress test
-   Low-intermediate coronary risk
-   Emergency department chest pain evaluation

### Anatomical Evaluation

-   Coronary artery anomalies
-   Bypass graft evaluation
-   Stent patency check
-   Pulmonary vein anatomy

### Calcium Scoring

-   Cardiovascular risk assessment
-   Asymptomatic high-risk individuals
-   Treatment decision support

## Pre-Cardiac CT Preparation

### General Preparation

-   4 hours fasting
-   Caffeine restriction (24 hours)
-   Heart rate control

### Medication Preparation

-   Beta blocker (to lower heart rate)
-   Nitroglycerin (coronary dilation)
-   Contrast allergy prevention (if needed)

## How is Cardiac CT Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **ECG connection**: Heart rhythm synchronization
2. **IV access**: For contrast injection
3. **Heart rate control**: Beta blocker if needed
4. **Nitroglycerin**: Coronary dilation
5. **Contrast injection**: Automatic injector
6. **Imaging**: With breath hold
7. **Image processing**: 3D reconstruction

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: 15-30 minutes

## Cardiac CT Results

### Calcium Score

| Score   | Risk Category     |
| ------- | ----------------- |
| 0       | Very low risk     |
| 1-100   | Low risk          |
| 101-400 | Intermediate risk |
| >400    | High risk         |

### Coronary Stenosis Evaluation

-   Normal: No stenosis
-   Minimal: <25%
-   Mild: 25-49%
-   Moderate: 50-69%
-   Severe: 70-99%
-   Occluded: 100%

## Cardiac CT Advantages and Limitations

### Advantages

-   Non-invasive
-   Fast results
-   High negative predictive value
-   Anatomical detail

### Limitations

-   Radiation exposure
-   Contrast material requirement
-   Image quality decreases at high heart rate
-   Evaluation difficulty in severe calcification
