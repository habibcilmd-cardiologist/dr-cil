LVAD (Left Ventricular Assist Device) is a mechanical device that supports the heart's pumping function in advanced heart failure. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in LVAD patient follow-up.

## What is LVAD?

LVAD is a mechanical device that takes blood from the left ventricle and pumps it to the aorta. It supports or completely takes over the heart's pumping function.

**LVAD Components:**

-   Pump (placed inside the heart)
-   Driveline (cable exiting the body)
-   Controller (pump control)
-   Batteries (power source)

## LVAD Indications

### Bridge Therapy

-   Bridge to heart transplant
-   Bridge to recovery
-   Bridge to decision

### Destination Therapy

-   Patients not suitable for heart transplant
-   Permanent mechanical support
-   Quality of life improvement

### Patient Selection

-   End-stage heart failure
-   Symptoms despite maximal medical therapy
-   Ejection fraction <25%
-   Inotropic dependence

## LVAD Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications

-   Right heart failure (severe)
-   Irreversible multiorgan failure
-   Active infection
-   Coagulopathy

### Relative Contraindications

-   Advanced age
-   Kidney failure
-   Liver failure
-   Psychosocial issues

## LVAD Surgery

### Preoperative

-   Comprehensive evaluation
-   Right heart function
-   Organ functions
-   Psychosocial evaluation

### Surgical Technique

1. **Sternotomy**: Chest opening
2. **Cardiopulmonary bypass**: Connection
3. **Pump placement**: To left ventricular apex
4. **Outflow graft**: Connection to aorta
5. **Driveline**: Exit through abdominal wall

### Surgery Duration

Total duration: 4-6 hours

## Life After LVAD

### Daily Care

-   Driveline care
-   Battery change
-   Controller monitoring
-   Infection prevention

### Anticoagulation

-   Warfarin use
-   INR monitoring (2.0-3.0)
-   Aspirin
-   Bleeding risk

## LVAD Complications

### Early Complications

-   Bleeding
-   Right heart failure
-   Infection
-   Arrhythmia

### Late Complications

-   Driveline infection
-   Pump thrombosis
-   Stroke
-   Gastrointestinal bleeding

## LVAD Results

### Survival

-   1-year survival: 80-85%
-   2-year survival: 70-75%
-   Quality of life improvement
