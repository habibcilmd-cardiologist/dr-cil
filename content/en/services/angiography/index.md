Coronary angiography is the imaging of heart vessels (coronary arteries) using X-rays and contrast material. This procedure is considered the gold standard in diagnosing coronary artery disease. Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in coronary angiography procedures.

## What is Coronary Angiography?

Coronary angiography is an invasive imaging method performed to evaluate the internal structure and blood flow of heart vessels.

**Purpose of the Procedure:**

-   Detection of coronary artery narrowings
-   Determination of stenosis degree
-   Assistance in treatment planning
-   Decision making for stent or bypass

## Coronary Angiography Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

**Stable Coronary Artery Disease:**

-   Typical angina pectoris
-   Positive stress test
-   Symptoms unresponsive to medical treatment

**Acute Coronary Syndrome:**

-   Unstable angina
-   NSTEMI (non-ST elevation myocardial infarction)
-   STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction)

**Other Indications:**

-   Heart failure (ischemic etiology investigation)
-   Pre-valve surgery evaluation
-   Cardiomyopathy evaluation
-   Unexplained chest pain

## Pre-Angiography Preparation

### Tests and Evaluations

-   Blood tests (kidney function, coagulation)
-   ECG
-   Echocardiography
-   Allergy history (contrast material)
-   Medication list review

### Patient Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Metformin discontinuation (48 hours before)
-   Anticoagulant adjustment
-   Groin or wrist area shaving
-   Hydration

## How is Angiography Performed?

### Access Routes

**Radial Access (Wrist):**

-   Less bleeding risk
-   Early mobilization
-   Better patient comfort
-   Preferred method

**Femoral Access (Groin):**

-   Larger catheter use
-   Preferred in complex procedures
-   Longer bed rest

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: Applied to access site
2. **Vessel puncture**: Artery entered with needle
3. **Sheath placement**: For catheter passage
4. **Catheter advancement**: Under fluoroscopy guidance
5. **Contrast injection**: Into coronary arteries
6. **Imaging**: Recording from different angles
7. **Catheter removal**: Hemostasis achieved

### Procedure Duration

Diagnostic angiography usually takes 15-30 minutes.

## Angiography Results

### Normal Findings

-   Smooth coronary arteries
-   No narrowing or blockage
-   Normal blood flow

### Abnormal Findings

| Stenosis Degree | Meaning           |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| <50%            | Mild stenosis     |
| 50-70%          | Moderate stenosis |
| 70-90%          | Severe stenosis   |
| >90%            | Critical stenosis |
| 100%            | Total occlusion   |

## Post-Angiography Treatment Options

Based on angiography results:

-   **Medical treatment**: In mild stenosis
-   **Coronary angioplasty/stent**: In severe stenosis
-   **Coronary bypass surgery**: In multi-vessel disease

## Angiography Risks

Procedure risks are low:

-   Access site complications (bleeding, hematoma)
-   Contrast nephropathy
-   Allergic reaction
-   Arrhythmia
-   Stroke (rare)
-   Myocardial infarction (rare)

## Post-Procedure Care

**Radial Access:**

-   2-4 hours pressure bandage
-   Same-day discharge possible

**Femoral Access:**

-   4-6 hours bed rest
-   Keep leg straight

## Frequently Asked Questions

{{< faq question="Is angiography painful?" >}}
Since local anesthesia is applied, no pain is felt during the procedure. There may be a temporary warm sensation when contrast is given.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How long does angiography take?" >}}
Diagnostic angiography takes 15-30 minutes. Duration may extend if stent is placed.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When can I go home after angiography?" >}}
Same-day discharge is possible with radial access, usually next day with femoral access.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is hospitalization required for angiography?" >}}
Usually performed as a day procedure. Hospitalization may be required in patients with high complication risk.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="When can I return to work after angiography?" >}}
Most patients can return to normal activities within 1-2 days.
