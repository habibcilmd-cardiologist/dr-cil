faq:
    - question: "Is transesophageal echocardiography painful?"
      answer: "Since sedation is applied, discomfort is minimal. Mild throat discomfort may be felt."
    - question: "How long does TEE take?"
      answer: "The procedure usually takes 20-40 minutes."
    - question: "What should I do before TEE?"
      answer: "You should not eat or drink for at least 6 hours before the procedure."
    - question: "When can I eat after TEE?"
      answer: "You can start eating and drinking after the numbness in your throat subsides (usually 1-2 hours)."
    - question: "Why does TEE provide better images than TTE?"
      answer: "Because the probe is closer to the heart, it provides excellent image quality, especially for the left atrium and valves."

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is detailed imaging of the heart through the esophagus. It provides higher resolution images than standard echocardiography (TTE).

## What is Transesophageal Echocardiography?

TEE involves imaging the heart from behind by placing a special ultrasound probe into the esophagus. Since the probe is very close to the heart, it provides excellent image quality.

**Advantages of TEE:**

-   Superior image resolution
-   Excellent evaluation of left atrium and appendage
-   Detailed aortic imaging
-   Clear visualization of valve structures
-   Gold standard for clot detection

## TEE Indications

### Valve Diseases

-   Mitral valve evaluation
-   Aortic valve evaluation
-   Suspected endocarditis
-   Vegetation detection
-   Prosthetic valve function
-   Paravalvular leak

### Thrombus Detection

-   Left atrial appendage clot screening
-   Pre-cardioversion evaluation
-   Stroke etiology investigation
-   Patent foramen ovale (PFO) evaluation

### Aortic Diseases

-   Aortic dissection
-   Aortic aneurysm
-   Atherosclerotic plaque
-   Aortic root evaluation

### Congenital Heart Diseases

-   Atrial septal defect (ASD)
-   Ventricular septal defect (VSD)
-   Shunt evaluation

### Interventional Procedure Guidance

-   TAVI
-   MitraClip
-   Left atrial appendage closure
-   ASD/PFO closure
-   Cardioversion

## Pre-TEE Preparation

### General Preparation

-   At least 6 hours fasting
-   Information about medication use
-   Removal of dentures
-   Esophageal disease inquiry

### Contraindications

-   Esophageal stricture
-   Esophageal varices (bleeding)
-   Esophageal tumor
-   Severe cervical spine disease
-   Uncontrolled airway

## How is TEE Performed?

### Procedure Steps

1. **IV access**: Vein access is opened for sedation
2. **Throat anesthesia**: Local anesthetic spray is applied
3. **Sedation**: Mild sedation is administered
4. **Probe placement**: Probe is slowly advanced into the esophagus
5. **Imaging**: Images are obtained from different angles
6. **Evaluation**: Valves, chambers, and aorta are examined
7. **Probe removal**: Probe is removed at the end of the procedure

### Procedure Duration

-   Total duration: 20-40 minutes
-   Imaging: 15-30 minutes

## Structures Evaluated in TEE

### Left Atrium

-   Size and function
-   Spontaneous echo contrast (smoke)
-   Appendage clot
-   PFO/ASD

### Mitral Valve

-   Leaflet morphology
-   Prolapse
-   Regurgitation jet
-   Stenosis evaluation
-   Annular calcification

### Aortic Valve

-   Valve morphology
-   Vegetation
-   Abscess
-   Regurgitation

### Aorta

-   Ascending aorta
-   Aortic arch
-   Descending aorta
-   Atherosclerotic plaque
-   Dissection flap

## TEE vs TTE Comparison

| Structure | TTE | TEE |
|-----------|-----|-----|
| Left atrial appendage | Poor | Excellent |
| Mitral valve | Good | Excellent |
| Aorta | Limited | Excellent |
| Left ventricle | Excellent | Good |
| Pericardial effusion | Excellent | Good |

## Post-TEE Care

-   1-2 hours monitoring
-   No eating or drinking until throat numbness subsides
-   No driving the same day (due to sedation)
-   Warm liquids for throat discomfort

## Complications

TEE is a safe procedure, serious complications are rare:

-   Sore throat (most common)
-   Nausea
-   Esophageal perforation (very rare)
-   Arrhythmia (transient)
