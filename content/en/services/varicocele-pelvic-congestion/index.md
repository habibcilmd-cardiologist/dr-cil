    - question: "What is varicocele?"
      answer: "Varicocele is the enlargement of veins around the testicle. It is one of the most common causes of male infertility and scrotal pain."
    - question: "What is varicocele embolization?"
      answer: "Embolization is the occlusion of dilated veins using coils or sclerosing agents via catheter. No surgery required."
    - question: "What is pelvic congestion syndrome?"
      answer: "Pelvic congestion is chronic pelvic pain caused by dilated pelvic veins in women. It is the female equivalent of varicocele."
    - question: "Is the embolization procedure painful?"
      answer: "No, the procedure is performed under local anesthesia. Mild discomfort may be felt but it is well tolerated."
    - question: "Does embolization improve fertility?"
      answer: "Yes, sperm quality improves by 60-70% after varicocele treatment."

Varicocele and pelvic congestion syndrome treatment involves interventional closure of dilated pelvic and gonadal veins. Cardiology specialist Assoc. Prof. Habib Çil has extensive experience in venous embolization procedures.

## What is Varicocele?

Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of veins in the pampiniform plexus around the testicle. It occurs in **15-20%** of men and is the most common treatable cause of male infertility.

**Prevalence:**
- General male population: 15-20%
- Infertile men: 40%
- Secondary infertility: 80%

### Varicocele Anatomy

```
Internal Spermatic Vein
        ↓
   Left: Drains to Renal Vein
   Right: Drains to IVC
        ↓
Pampiniform Plexus (Around testicle)
```

**Left side dominance (85-90%):**
- Left internal spermatic vein drains at right angle to renal vein
- Longer distance
- Nutcracker effect

### Varicocele Grading

| Grade | Clinical Findings |
|-------|-------------------|
| **Subclinical** | Detected only by Doppler US |
| **Grade I** | Palpable with Valsalva |
| **Grade II** | Palpable at rest |
| **Grade III** | Visible to the eye |

## Varicocele Symptoms

### Signs and Symptoms

- **Scrotal pain/discomfort:** Most common
- **Heaviness sensation:** Especially when standing
- **Testicular atrophy:** Long-term
- **Infertility:** Impaired sperm quality

### Infertility Mechanisms

1. Increased testicular temperature
2. Venous stasis and hypoxia
3. Adrenal metabolite reflux
4. Increased reactive oxygen species

## Varicocele Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

- Standing examination
- "Bag of worms" appearance
- Prominent with Valsalva

### Imaging

**Scrotal Doppler US:**
- Primary diagnostic method
- Vein diameter >3 mm
- Reflux with Valsalva

**Criteria:**
- Vein diameter ≥3 mm
- Reflux duration >1 second
- Multiple dilated veins

## Pelvic Congestion Syndrome

### Definition

Pelvic Congestion Syndrome (PCS) is chronic pelvic pain caused by dilation of ovarian and pelvic veins in women.

### Epidemiology

- **30%** of chronic pelvic pain
- More common in reproductive-age women
- Increased in multiparous women

### Pelvic Congestion Symptoms

**Pain Characteristics:**
- Chronic, dull pelvic pain
- Worsens with standing
- Worsens after intercourse (dyspareunia)
- Intensifies before menstruation
- Relieved by lying down

**Associated Findings:**
- Vulvar varices
- Leg varicose veins
- Dysmenorrhea
- Dysuria (painful urination)

### Pelvic Congestion Diagnosis

**Transabdominal/Transvaginal US:**
- Dilated ovarian veins (>6 mm)
- Dilated arcuate veins
- Uterine congestion

**MR Venography:**
- Detailed anatomy
- Non-invasive
- Treatment planning

**Pelvic Venography:**
- Gold standard
- Same session treatment possible

## Interventional Treatment

### Varicocele Embolization

**Technique:**

1. **Access:** Femoral or jugular vein
2. **Catheterization:** Selective internal spermatic vein
3. **Venography:** Anatomy assessment
4. **Embolization:** 
   - Coils (metal spirals)
   - Sclerosing agent (polidocanol)
   - Glue (tissue adhesive)
5. **Control venography**

**Embolic Materials:**

| Material | Property | Use |
|----------|----------|-----|
| Coil | Mechanical occlusion | Primary |
| Sclerosant | Chemical injury | Adjunct |
| Glue | Rapid occlusion | Special cases |

### Pelvic Congestion Embolization

**Target Veins:**
- Ovarian veins (bilateral)
- Internal iliac vein branches
- Pelvic varices

**Technique:**
1. Femoral or jugular access
2. Left ovarian vein catheterization
3. Venography
4. Coil + Sclerosant embolization
5. Right ovarian vein procedure
6. Internal iliac branches (if needed)

## Treatment Outcomes

### Varicocele Embolization

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical success | 95-98% |
| Clinical success | 85-90% |
| Sperm improvement | 60-70% |
| Pregnancy rate | 40-50% |
| Recurrence | 5-10% |

### Pelvic Congestion Embolization

| Parameter | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Technical success | 98% |
| Pain reduction | 75-85% |
| Complete response | 50-60% |
| Recurrence | 8-12% |

## Embolization vs Surgery

| Feature | Embolization | Surgery |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Anesthesia | Local | General/Spinal |
| Incision | None | Yes |
| Hospital stay | Outpatient | 1-2 days |
| Return to work | 1-2 days | 1-2 weeks |
| Recurrence | 5-10% | 5-15% |
| Bilateral treatment | Same session | 2 sessions |

## Post-Procedure Care

### Early Period

- Daily activities: 24-48 hours later
- Heavy activities: Avoid for 1 week
- Sexual activity: After 1 week

### Medications

- Analgesics: Paracetamol/NSAIDs
- Antibiotics: Not routinely recommended

### Follow-up

- Month 1: Clinical evaluation
- Month 3: Doppler US + Semen analysis
- Month 6: Semen analysis

## Complications

### Early

| Complication | Frequency | Management |
|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Groin pain | 10-20% | Analgesics |
| Testicular pain | 5-10% | Analgesics, resolves over time |
| Access site hematoma | 2-3% | Compression |
| Coil migration | <1% | Retrieval |

### Late

- Recurrence: 5-10% (re-embolization)
- Testicular atrophy: Rare
- Hydrocele: Rare

## Special Situations

### Bilateral Varicocele

- Can be treated in same session
- Jugular access preferred
- Both internal spermatic veins embolized

### Post-Recurrence

- Collateral veins
- Re-embolization possible
- High success rate

### Adolescent Varicocele

- Testis volume difference >20%
- Ipsilateral testicular atrophy
- Progressive varicocele
