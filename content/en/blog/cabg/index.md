faq:
- question: Is bypass surgery risky?
  answer: With modern techniques, surgical success is over 95%. Risk varies by patient; age, comorbidities, and heart condition are the main factors.
- question: How long will I live after bypass?
  answer: 10-year survival is 80-90%. Lifestyle changes, regular medication use, and follow-up are important.
- question: Can I exercise after bypass?
  answer: Yes, regular exercise is recommended after recovery (usually 3 months). Walking, cycling, and swimming are safe activities.
- question: How long do bypass grafts last?
  answer: LIMA (left internal mammary artery) graft can last 20+ years, saphenous vein graft 10-15 years. Arterial grafts last longer.
- question: Can I have stent instead of bypass?
  answer: In some patients, yes. The decision is made by the heart team based on the number of vessels, location of blockage, and patient's overall condition.
- question: How long does bypass surgery take?
  answer: Surgery usually takes 3-6 hours. It may vary depending on the number of bypasses and technique used.
- question: How many days in hospital after bypass?
  answer: Generally 1-2 days in ICU, 5-7 days in ward, totaling 7-10 days in hospital.
- question: What is off-pump bypass?
  answer: It is bypass surgery performed while the heart is beating, without cardiopulmonary bypass machine. Applied in selected patients with certain advantages.

Heart bypass surgery is a surgical procedure that provides blood flow to the heart muscle by creating a new vessel pathway around blocked coronary arteries. In this comprehensive guide, we detail how CABG surgery is performed, who it is applied to, the risks, and the recovery process.

## What is Heart Bypass?

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery is creating a new vessel pathway around blocked or severely stenosed coronary arteries. Blood vessels taken from other parts of the body are used to carry blood beyond the blockage.

Coronary arteries are the vessels that supply the heart muscle. When these arteries narrow or become blocked, the heart muscle cannot receive adequate blood and oxygen. Bypass surgery "bypasses" the blockage to restore blood supply to the heart muscle.

**Types of Bypass Grafts:**

-   **Left internal mammary artery (LIMA):** The most commonly used and most durable graft. Connected to the left coronary artery.
-   **Right internal mammary artery (RIMA):** Second arterial graft option.
-   **Saphenous vein graft:** Vein taken from the leg. Frequently used when multiple bypasses are needed.
-   **Radial artery graft:** Artery taken from the arm.

## Who Needs Bypass Surgery?

### Definite Indications

-   **Left main coronary disease:** More than 50% stenosis in the left main coronary artery
-   **Three-vessel disease:** Significant stenosis in all three main coronary arteries
-   **Multivessel disease with low ejection fraction:** In patients with reduced heart pumping power
-   **Diabetic multivessel disease:** In patients with diabetes and multiple blocked vessels

### Relative Indications

-   Lesions not suitable for stenting (chronic total occlusion, calcified vessels)
-   After failed stent procedure
-   Recurrent chest pain (angina)
-   Extensive coronary disease in acute coronary syndrome

## How is Bypass Surgery Performed?

### Preoperative Preparation

-   **Comprehensive cardiac evaluation:** Echocardiography, coronary angiography
-   **Laboratory tests:** Complete blood count, kidney and liver functions
-   **Pulmonary evaluation:** Respiratory function tests
-   **Carotid evaluation:** Assessment of neck vessels

### Surgical Techniques

**Conventional CABG (On-pump):**
-   Performed with cardiopulmonary bypass machine
-   Heart is temporarily stopped
-   Sternum is opened from the middle
-   Most commonly used technique

**Off-Pump Bypass:**
-   No cardiopulmonary bypass machine used
-   Surgery performed while heart is beating
-   Preferred in selected patients
-   May have kidney protective advantages

**Minimally Invasive CABG:**
-   Small incisions used
-   May be robot-assisted
-   Faster recovery
-   Applied in certain patients

### Surgical Steps

1. **Anesthesia:** General anesthesia is administered
2. **Sternotomy:** Chest bone is opened
3. **Graft preparation:** LIMA, saphenous vein, or other vessels are prepared
4. **Cardiopulmonary bypass:** Connection established (if on-pump)
5. **Bypass creation:** Grafts are sewn beyond the blockage
6. **Closure:** Chest bone is closed with wires

### Surgery Duration

Total duration: **3-6 hours** (varies by number of bypasses)

## Post-Bypass Recovery

### Hospital Stay

| Stage | Duration | Details |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Intensive care | 1-2 days | Close monitoring and mechanical ventilation |
| Ward | 5-7 days | Mobilization and exercise initiation |
| **Total** | **7-10 days** | Uncomplicated course |

### Home Recovery Process

-   **First 2 weeks:** Primarily bed rest, light walking indoors
-   **4-6 weeks:** Light activities, no driving
-   **8-12 weeks:** Gradual return to normal activities
-   **3 months:** Full recovery, return to work

{{< alert "warning" >}}
**Attention!** Complete healing of the chest bone takes 8-12 weeks. During this time, do not lift heavy objects, do not use your arms for support when standing up, and avoid sudden movements.

## Bypass Results and Success Rates

### Success Statistics

-   **Surgical success:** >95%
-   **10-year survival:** 80-90%
-   **Symptom improvement:** >90%
-   **LIMA graft patency (10 years):** >90%
-   **Saphenous vein graft patency (10 years):** 50-60%

### Possible Complications

-   **Bleeding:** May require reoperation in 2-5%
-   **Infection:** Wound or sternal infection
-   **Arrhythmia:** Atrial fibrillation is most common
-   **Kidney failure:** May be temporary
-   **Stroke:** 1-2% rate (rare)

## Bypass vs Stent: Which is Better?

| Feature | Bypass | Stent (PCI) |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Invasiveness | High (open surgery) | Low (closed procedure) |
| Recovery time | Long (3 months) | Short (1-2 weeks) |
| Long-term outcomes | Better (especially in multivessel disease) | Variable |
| Repeat intervention rate | Low | High |
| In diabetic patients | Preferred | Second choice |
| Left main coronary disease | Standard treatment | In selected cases |

The decision is made by the **heart team** (cardiologist, cardiac surgeon) evaluating the patient's anatomy, comorbidities, and preferences.

## Life After Bypass

### Medical Treatment

-   **Aspirin:** Lifelong use
-   **Statin:** Cholesterol control
-   **Beta blocker:** Heart protection
-   **ACE inhibitor:** Blood pressure control

### Lifestyle Changes

-   **Quit smoking:** The most important step
-   **Healthy eating:** Mediterranean diet recommended
-   **Regular exercise:** 150 minutes moderate intensity per week
-   **Weight control:** Reach ideal weight
-   **Stress management:** Cardiac rehabilitation programs

### Cardiac Rehabilitation

Participation in a cardiac rehabilitation program after bypass accelerates recovery and improves long-term outcomes. The program includes:

-   Supervised exercise
-   Nutrition counseling
-   Psychological support
-   Risk factor management education
