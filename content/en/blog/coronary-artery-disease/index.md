Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. This condition develops due to narrowing or blockage in the arteries that supply the heart and can be controlled with early diagnosis and treatment. This comprehensive guide examines the causes, symptoms, diagnostic methods, and current treatment options for coronary artery disease.

## What is Coronary Artery Disease?

Coronary arteries are blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the heart muscle (myocardium). Coronary artery disease occurs when plaque buildup due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) causes narrowing or blockage in these vessels.

Plaques are composed of cholesterol, fat, calcium, and other substances. Over time, these plaques grow and narrow the artery, reducing blood flow to the heart muscle. This can lead to chest pain (angina) or heart attack when the artery becomes completely blocked.

### The Atherosclerosis Process

Atherosclerosis develops gradually over years:

**1. Endothelial Damage**

-   High blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, or high cholesterol damages the inner lining (endothelium) of blood vessels

**2. Fatty Streaking**

-   LDL cholesterol begins accumulating in the damaged area
-   Inflammatory process begins

**3. Fibrous Plaque Formation**

-   Smooth muscle cells and connective tissue accumulate
-   Plaque thickens and narrows the vessel lumen

**4. Complex Lesion**

-   Calcification develops
-   Risk of plaque rupture increases
-   Clot formation and acute coronary syndrome

## Causes and Risk Factors of Coronary Artery Disease

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

**Age**

-   Men over 45 years
-   Women over 55 years or post-menopausal

**Gender**

-   Higher risk in men
-   Risk increases in women after menopause

**Family History**

-   Early heart disease in first-degree relatives
-   Before age 55 in male relatives, before 65 in female relatives

**Genetic Predisposition**

-   Familial hypercholesterolemia
-   Genetic inflammatory markers

### Modifiable Risk Factors

**Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**

-   Constant pressure on vessel walls
-   Causes endothelial damage
-   Target: <130/80 mmHg

**High Cholesterol**

-   Elevated LDL ("bad" cholesterol)
-   Low HDL ("good" cholesterol)
-   High triglycerides

**Smoking**

-   Most important preventable risk factor
-   Endothelial damage, oxidative stress, increased clotting
-   Passive smoking is also risky

**Diabetes**

-   Microvascular and macrovascular damage
-   Acceleration of atherosclerosis
-   Risk of silent ischemia

**Obesity**

-   Especially abdominal obesity
-   Insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome

## Coronary Artery Disease Symptoms

Symptoms vary depending on the degree and rate of narrowing:

### Stable Angina Pectoris

-   Chest pain or pressure triggered by exertion
-   Typically in the center or left side of chest
-   May radiate to arm, jaw, or back
-   Lasts 5-15 minutes
-   Relieved by rest or nitroglycerin

### Unstable Angina

-   Pain even at rest
-   New onset or worsening angina
-   Longer duration pain (>20 minutes)
-   Not fully relieved by medication
-   May herald heart attack

### Heart Attack (Myocardial Infarction)

## Diagnostic Methods

Coronary artery disease diagnosis is made through clinical evaluation and various tests:

### Non-Invasive Tests

**Electrocardiography (ECG)**

-   First-line test
-   Ischemia findings (ST changes)
-   Previous infarction signs
-   Rhythm abnormalities

**Exercise Stress Test**

-   ECG monitoring on treadmill or bicycle
-   Detection of ischemia during exercise

### Atypical Symptoms

## Prevention of Coronary Artery Disease

Primary and secondary prevention strategies are vitally important:

### Primary Prevention (Before Disease)

-   Regular health check-ups
-   Early detection and control of risk factors
-   Healthy lifestyle habits
-   Early screening if family history present

### Secondary Prevention (After Disease)

-   Full adherence to medication therapy
-   Maintaining lifestyle changes
-   Regular cardiology follow-up
-   Cardiac rehabilitation programs

## When to See a Doctor

Consult a cardiologist if you experience:

-   Chest pain or pressure triggered by exertion
-   Chest discomfort with shortness of breath
-   If you have risk factors (diabetes, hypertension, smoking, family history)
-   Men over 40 and post-menopausal women
-   Regular check-ups if you have known heart disease

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

{{< faq question="Can coronary artery disease be completely cured?" >}}
Atherosclerosis is a chronic process and cannot be completely reversed. However, plaque progression can be stopped with lifestyle changes and medication therapy, and in some cases, regression can be achieved. Stents or bypass restore blood flow in blocked vessels but don't treat the disease itself; therefore, lifestyle changes and medication must be continued.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is stent or bypass better?" >}}
Both treatments have their own indications. Stent is less invasive and preferred for single or double vessel disease. Bypass provides better long-term results in multi-vessel disease, left main coronary stenosis, and diabetic patients. Treatment decision is based on angiography findings, comorbidities, and patient characteristics.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How long should I take medications after a stent?" >}}
After stent placement, dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin + clopidogrel/prasugrel/ticagrelor) should generally be used for at least 6-12 months. Aspirin continues for life. Statins and other protective medications should also be used indefinitely. Medication discontinuation decisions should always be made with your doctor.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does every narrowing seen on angiography require a stent?" >}}
No, not every narrowing requires a stent. The degree of stenosis (>70% is significant), location, presence of symptoms, and functional tests (FFR) are evaluated. Some narrowings can be monitored with medication therapy alone.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Can I exercise with coronary artery disease?" >}}
Yes, regular exercise is an important part of coronary artery disease treatment. However, your exercise program should be planned by your doctor, and participation in cardiac rehabilitation programs is recommended. Avoid sudden intense exercise; increase gradually.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="What should I do if there's heart disease in my family?" >}}
If first-degree relatives have heart disease at an early age (before 55 in men, before 65 in women), your risk is increased. In this case, you should control your risk factors more strictly and have regular check-ups starting from your 20s-30s. Proactive lifestyle changes are very important.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does coronary artery disease progress differently in women?" >}}
Yes, coronary artery disease generally appears about 10 years later in women compared to men (with decreased estrogen protection after menopause). Additionally, atypical symptoms (shortness of breath, fatigue, back pain) are more common in women. Therefore, diagnosis in women may sometimes be delayed.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Can stress cause coronary artery disease?" >}}
Chronic stress indirectly increases coronary artery disease risk by leading to behaviors such as hypertension, unhealthy eating, and smoking. Additionally, acute stress (sudden anger, shock) can trigger heart attack by causing coronary spasm or plaque rupture. Learning stress management techniques is important.
