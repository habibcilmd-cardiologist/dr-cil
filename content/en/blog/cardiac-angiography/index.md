faq:
- question: Is cardiac angiography painful?
  answer: It is performed under local anesthesia and generally no pain is felt. Only a temporary warm sensation may occur during contrast injection.
- question: How long is hospital stay required after angiography?
  answer: With radial approach, same-day discharge is usually possible. Femoral approach requires 4-6 hours of bed rest.
- question: What are the risks of angiography?
  answer: Serious complications are rare. Bleeding, infection, and contrast reaction may occur.
- question: When can I return to normal activity after angiography?
  answer: With radial approach, 1-2 days; with femoral approach, 3-5 days to return to normal activities.
- question: Am I awake during angiography?
  answer: Yes, it is performed under local anesthesia and you remain awake throughout the procedure.

## What is Cardiac Angiography?

Cardiac angiography is the imaging of heart vessels using contrast medium. Stenosis, occlusion, and anomalies in coronary arteries are detected.

**Purposes of Cardiac Angiography:**

-   Diagnosis of coronary artery disease
-   Determining the degree of stenosis
-   Treatment planning
-   Intervention decision

## Cardiac Angiography Indications

### Diagnostic Indications

-   Stable angina pectoris
-   Acute coronary syndrome
-   Positive stress test
-   Heart failure evaluation

### Interventional Indications

-   Stent planning
-   Before bypass surgery
-   Before valve surgery
-   Structural heart disease

## Preparation Before Cardiac Angiography

### Patient Preparation

-   6-8 hours fasting
-   Kidney function tests
-   Blood thinner adjustment
-   Allergy history inquiry

### Contraindications

-   Severe renal failure
-   Contrast allergy
-   Active infection
-   Uncontrolled hypertension

## How is Cardiac Angiography Performed?

### Access Routes

**Femoral Approach:**

-   Entry from groin
-   Classical method
-   Large catheters can be used

**Radial Approach:**

-   Entry from wrist
-   Fewer complications
-   Early mobilization

### Procedure Steps

1. **Local anesthesia**: To entry site
2. **Arterial puncture**: Femoral or radial
3. **Guidewire advancement**: To aorta
4. **Catheter placement**: To coronary ostia
5. **Contrast injection**: For imaging
6. **Image recording**: From different angles
7. **Catheter removal**: End of procedure
8. **Hemostasis**: Bleeding control

### Procedure Duration

Total time: 15-30 minutes

## Cardiac Angiography Results

### Normal Findings

-   Smooth coronary arteries
-   No stenosis
-   Normal flow

### Pathological Findings

-   Coronary stenosis
-   Complete occlusion
-   Aneurysm
-   Anomaly

### Stenosis Grading

| Grade    | Stenosis Rate |
| -------- | ------------- |
| Mild     | <50%          |
| Moderate | 50-70%        |
| Severe   | 70-90%        |
| Critical | >90%          |
