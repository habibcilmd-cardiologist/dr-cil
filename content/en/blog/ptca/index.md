faq:
- question: What is the difference between PTCA and stent?
  answer: PTCA is only balloon dilation, stent is permanent metal mesh placement.
- question: Will the vessel narrow again after PTCA?
  answer: Restenosis rate is 30-40% with PTCA alone. With stent, this drops to 5-10%.
- question: Is PTCA painful?
  answer: It is performed under local anesthesia. Temporary chest pain may occur when balloon is inflated.
- question: How long does PTCA take?
  answer: The procedure usually takes 15-60 minutes.
- question: When will I be discharged after PTCA?
  answer: Usually same day or next day discharge is possible.

PTCA (Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty) is the widening of coronary artery stenoses with a balloon. It forms the foundation of modern coronary interventions. This comprehensive guide covers the history, indications, and current applications of PTCA in detail.

## What is PTCA?

PTCA is the widening of coronary artery stenoses with a balloon at the catheter tip. It was first performed by Andreas Grüntzig in 1977.

**History of PTCA:**

-   1977: First PTCA
-   1986: First stent
-   1990s: Drug-coated stents
-   Today: Modern PCI

## PTCA Indications

### PTCA Alone

-   Small vessels
-   Situations where stent placement is difficult
-   Temporary treatment

### PTCA Before Stent

-   Predilation
-   Lesion preparation
-   For stent passage

### PTCA After Stent

-   Postdilation
-   Optimal expansion
-   Malapposition correction

## How is PTCA Performed?

### Balloon Types

**Semi-Compliant Balloon:**

-   For predilation
-   Flexible structure
-   Low pressure

**Non-Compliant Balloon:**

-   For postdilation
-   High pressure
-   Stent expansion

**Cutting Balloon:**

-   Calcified lesions
-   In-stent restenosis
-   Fibrotic lesions

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Radial or femoral
2. **Guide catheter**: To coronary ostium
3. **Guidewire**: Through lesion
4. **Balloon placement**: Over lesion
5. **Balloon inflation**: At specific pressure
6. **Balloon deflation**: Result evaluation
7. **Re-inflation**: If needed

### Procedure Duration

Total time: 15-60 minutes

## PTCA Results

### Success Criteria

-   Residual stenosis <50%
-   TIMI 3 flow
-   No dissection
-   No complications

### Complications

-   Dissection
-   Acute occlusion
-   Perforation
-   Spasm
-   Slow flow

## PTCA vs Stent

| Feature      | PTCA        | Stent       |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Restenosis   | 30-40%      | 5-10%       |
| Acute occlusion | Higher   | Lower       |
| Antiplatelet | Short-term  | Long-term   |
| Cost         | Lower       | Higher      |

## PTCA Today

In modern practice, PTCA is usually performed together with stent implantation. PTCA alone is preferred in rare situations.

**PTCA Alone Indications:**

-   Very small vessels (<2mm)
-   Situations where stent placement is technically difficult
-   Temporary bridge therapy
