faq:
- question: Is pericardiocentesis painful?
  answer: It is performed under local anesthesia and usually no pain is felt. A pressure sensation may occur during the procedure, but pain is minimal.
- question: Does fluid accumulate again after pericardiocentesis?
  answer: It depends on the underlying cause. It may recur in cancer or some chronic diseases. In such cases, permanent drain or pericardial window may be required.
- question: How long does pericardiocentesis take?
  answer: The procedure usually takes 30-60 minutes. It may vary depending on the amount of fluid and patient's condition.
- question: When will I be discharged after pericardiocentesis?
  answer: Usually discharge is possible after 1-2 days of observation. Earlier discharge is possible in patients with uncomplicated course.
- question: What are the risks of pericardiocentesis?
  answer: Serious complications are rare (less than 5%). Heart perforation, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, and infection are potential risks.
- question: Why does fluid accumulate in the pericardium?
  answer: Infections (viral, bacterial, tuberculosis), cancer, kidney failure, autoimmune diseases, post-cardiac surgery, or trauma can cause fluid accumulation.
- question: What is cardiac tamponade?
  answer: It is when fluid accumulated in the pericardial space compresses the heart and impairs its pumping function. It requires emergency intervention and is life-threatening.
- question: What should I do after pericardiocentesis?
  answer: Attend regular check-ups, continue treatment of the underlying cause, and seek immediate medical attention if sudden chest pain or shortness of breath occurs.

Pericardiocentesis is draining fluid accumulated between the pericardium (heart sac) and the heart with a needle. This interventional procedure, performed for both diagnostic (fluid analysis) and therapeutic purposes (in emergencies like tamponade), can be life-saving. In this guide, we detail the causes of pericardial effusion, the pericardiocentesis procedure, and the recovery process.

## What is Pericardiocentesis?

Pericardiocentesis is draining fluid accumulated in the pericardial space (the area between the membrane surrounding the heart and the heart itself) using a needle and catheter. Normally, this space contains only 15-50 ml of fluid that allows the heart to move freely.

When the amount of fluid increases (pericardial effusion), the heart can become compressed and pumping function can be impaired. This condition is called **cardiac tamponade** and requires emergency intervention.

**Purposes of Pericardiocentesis:**

-   **Diagnostic:** Obtaining a sample for laboratory analysis of the fluid (infection, cancer screening)
-   **Therapeutic:** Draining excess fluid to reduce pressure on the heart
-   **Emergency:** Life-saving intervention in cardiac tamponade

## Causes of Pericardial Effusion

There are many causes of fluid accumulation in the pericardium:

### Infectious Causes

-   **Viral pericarditis:** Most common cause (Coxsackie, Echovirus, Adenovirus)
-   **Bacterial pericarditis:** Severe course, requires urgent treatment
-   **Tuberculous pericarditis:** Important especially in developing countries

### Non-infectious Causes

-   **Malignancy:** Lung cancer, breast cancer, lymphoma, leukemia
-   **Uremia:** Advanced kidney failure
-   **Autoimmune diseases:** Systemic lupus, rheumatoid arthritis
-   **Hypothyroidism:** Underactive thyroid gland
-   **Post-cardiac injury syndrome:** After heart surgery or myocardial infarction
-   **Trauma:** Chest trauma, surgical complication
-   **Idiopathic:** Cases where cause cannot be found

## Pericardiocentesis Indications

### Emergency Indications

-   **Cardiac tamponade:** Most urgent indication
-   **Hemodynamic instability:** Low blood pressure, signs of shock
-   **Respiratory distress:** Severe shortness of breath

### Elective Indications

-   Large effusion (over 20 mm)
-   Symptomatic effusion (shortness of breath, chest pain)
-   Diagnostic purpose (suspicion of malignancy, infection investigation)
-   Recurrent effusion

## Cardiac Tamponade: Emergency Situation

Cardiac tamponade is when pericardial fluid compresses the heart and prevents it from filling during diastole (relaxation phase). It is life-threatening.

**Tamponade Signs (Beck's Triad):**
1. Low blood pressure (hypotension)
2. Distended neck veins
3. Muffled heart sounds

**Other Findings:**
-   Pulsus paradoxus (weakening of pulse during inspiration)
-   Tachycardia (rapid heartbeat)
-   Shortness of breath
-   Restlessness, feeling of fear

{{< alert "danger" >}}
**Emergency!** If you have signs of cardiac tamponade, go to the emergency room immediately. This condition can be life-threatening within minutes.

## How is Pericardiocentesis Performed?

### Pre-procedure Preparation

-   **Echocardiography:** Determining the amount and location of fluid
-   **Coagulation tests:** Assessment of bleeding risk
-   **Intravenous access:** IV line for emergency medication
-   **Monitoring:** ECG, blood pressure, oxygen tracking

### Procedure Techniques

**Subxiphoid Approach (Most Common):**
-   Entry just below the xiphoid process
-   Safe entry under echocardiographic guidance
-   Lowest complication risk

**Apical Approach:**
-   Entry from the heart apex (left chest lateral wall)
-   Preferred when fluid accumulates more in this area

**Parasternal Approach:**
-   Entry from beside the sternum
-   Rarely used

### Procedure Steps

1. **Sterile preparation:** Sterilization of the chest area
2. **Local anesthesia:** Anesthetic injection to the entry site
3. **Needle entry:** Reaching the pericardial space under echocardiographic guidance
4. **Fluid aspiration:** Withdrawing fluid with a syringe, obtaining samples
5. **Catheter placement:** If needed for complete drainage
6. **Drainage:** Complete draining of fluid
7. **Catheter removal:** At the end of procedure or after a few days

### Procedure Duration

Total duration: **30-60 minutes**

## Pericardiocentesis Results

### Success Rates

| Parameter | Rate |
|-----------|------|
| Technical success | >95% |
| Symptom improvement | >90% |
| Complication rate | <5% |

### Fluid Analysis

The obtained fluid is sent for the following tests:

-   **Cytology:** Investigation for cancer cells
-   **Biochemistry:** Protein, LDH, glucose levels
-   **Microbiology:** Investigation for bacteria, fungi, tuberculosis
-   **Cell count:** Leukocyte and erythrocyte counts

Results help determine the cause of the effusion.

## Possible Complications

Pericardiocentesis is a safe procedure in experienced hands, but some risks exist:

-   **Heart perforation:** Rare but serious (1-2%)
-   **Arrhythmia:** Temporary rhythm disturbances during the procedure
-   **Pneumothorax:** Accidental entry into the lung
-   **Infection:** Very rare
-   **Bleeding:** From the entry site

Complication risk is significantly reduced in procedures performed under echocardiographic guidance.

## After Pericardiocentesis

### Follow-up

-   **Echocardiography check:** Checking for fluid recurrence (after 24-48 hours)
-   **Clinical monitoring:** Following symptoms
-   **Treatment of underlying cause:** Infection, cancer, etc.

### In Case of Recurrent Effusion

In some patients, fluid may reaccumulate. In such cases:

-   **Pericardial window:** Surgically creating a permanent opening in the pericardium
-   **Pericardiectomy:** Surgical removal of the pericardium
-   **Sclerotherapy:** Adhesion of pericardial layers
