Aortic valve disease is dysfunction of the valve between the left ventricle and aorta. It has two main forms: aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation.

## What is Aortic Valve Disease?

The aortic valve regulates blood flow from the left ventricle to the aorta. In valve disease, this function is impaired and creates additional burden on the heart.

**Types of Aortic Valve Disease:**

-   Aortic stenosis
-   Aortic regurgitation
-   Combined aortic valve disease

## Aortic Stenosis

### Causes

-   Degenerative calcification (age-related)
-   Bicuspid aortic valve (congenital)
-   Rheumatic heart disease

### Symptoms

-   Chest pain (angina)
-   Shortness of breath
-   Fainting (syncope)
-   Exercise intolerance

### Grading

| Grade    | Valve Area  | Mean Gradient |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Mild     | >1.5 cm²    | <20 mmHg      |
| Moderate | 1.0-1.5 cm² | 20-40 mmHg    |
| Severe   | <1.0 cm²    | >40 mmHg      |
| Critical | <0.6 cm²    | >60 mmHg      |

## Aortic Regurgitation

### Causes

-   Aortic root dilation
-   Bicuspid aortic valve
-   Endocarditis
-   Rheumatic disease
-   Aortic dissection

### Symptoms

-   Shortness of breath
-   Palpitations
-   Fatigue
-   Leg swelling

### Grading

-   Mild: Jet width <25%
-   Moderate: Jet width 25-64%
-   Severe: Jet width ≥65%

## Aortic Valve Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Systolic murmur (stenosis)
-   Diastolic murmur (regurgitation)
-   Pulse changes

### Imaging

-   Echocardiography (gold standard)
-   Transesophageal echo
-   Cardiac MRI
-   Cardiac CT

### Additional Tests

-   ECG
-   Exercise test
-   Coronary angiography

## Aortic Valve Disease Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Symptom control
-   Heart failure treatment
-   Blood pressure control
-   Regular follow-up

### Surgical Treatment

**Aortic Valve Replacement (AVR):**

-   Mechanical valve
-   Bioprosthetic valve
-   Open heart surgery

### Interventional Treatment

**TAVI (Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation):**

-   For high-risk patients
-   Minimally invasive
-   Rapid recovery

## Treatment Decision

Treatment decision depends on:

-   Disease severity
-   Presence of symptoms
-   Left ventricular function
-   Surgical risk score
-   Patient preference
