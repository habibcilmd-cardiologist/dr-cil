Mitral valve disease is dysfunction of the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle. It has two main forms: mitral stenosis and mitral regurgitation. Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil has extensive experience in diagnosing and treating mitral valve diseases.

## What is Mitral Valve Disease?

The mitral valve regulates blood flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. In valve disease, this function is impaired and creates additional burden on the heart.

**Types of Mitral Valve Disease:**

-   Mitral stenosis
-   Mitral regurgitation
-   Mitral valve prolapse
-   Combined mitral valve disease

## Mitral Stenosis

### Causes

-   Rheumatic heart disease (most common)
-   Degenerative calcification
-   Congenital mitral stenosis
-   Systemic diseases

### Symptoms

-   Shortness of breath
-   Palpitations (atrial fibrillation)
-   Fatigue
-   Hemoptysis (coughing blood)
-   Leg swelling

### Grading

| Grade    | Valve Area  | Mean Gradient |
| -------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Mild     | >1.5 cm²    | <5 mmHg       |
| Moderate | 1.0-1.5 cm² | 5-10 mmHg     |
| Severe   | <1.0 cm²    | >10 mmHg      |

## Mitral Regurgitation

### Causes

**Primary (Organic):**

-   Mitral valve prolapse
-   Rheumatic disease
-   Endocarditis
-   Degenerative changes

**Secondary (Functional):**

-   Dilated cardiomyopathy
-   Ischemic heart disease
-   Left ventricular dilation

### Symptoms

-   Shortness of breath
-   Fatigue
-   Palpitations
-   Leg swelling

### Grading

-   Mild: Regurgitant volume <30 ml
-   Moderate: Regurgitant volume 30-59 ml
-   Severe: Regurgitant volume ≥60 ml

## Mitral Valve Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Diastolic rumble (stenosis)
-   Systolic murmur (regurgitation)
-   Heart sound changes

### Imaging

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Transesophageal echocardiography
-   Cardiac MRI
-   Cardiac CT

### Additional Tests

-   ECG
-   Holter monitoring
-   Exercise test
-   Coronary angiography

## Mitral Valve Disease Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Diuretics
-   Beta blockers
-   Anticoagulation (if AF present)
-   Heart failure treatment

### Interventional Treatment

**Mitral Balloon Valvuloplasty:**

-   In suitable mitral stenosis
-   Minimally invasive
-   Rapid recovery

**MitraClip:**

-   In severe mitral regurgitation
-   For high-risk surgical patients
-   Catheter-based treatment

### Surgical Treatment

**Mitral Valve Repair:**

-   Preferred method
-   Preservation of own valve
-   Better long-term outcomes

**Mitral Valve Replacement:**

-   If repair not possible
-   Mechanical or bioprosthetic valve
