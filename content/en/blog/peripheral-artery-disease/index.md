Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a serious circulatory disorder that occurs when arteries in the legs and arms narrow or become blocked. This condition, which usually develops due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries), can prevent serious complications with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. In this comprehensive guide, I will discuss in detail what peripheral artery disease is, its symptoms, risk factors, diagnostic methods, and treatment options.

## What is Peripheral Artery Disease?

Peripheral artery disease is a condition where arteries outside the heart and brain narrow or become blocked. It most commonly affects leg arteries but can also affect arteries going to the arms, stomach, kidneys, and other organs. The disease usually develops as a result of atherosclerosis, a process where fatty plaques accumulate on artery walls.

In normal healthy arteries, blood flows freely and carries sufficient oxygen and nutrients to tissues. In arteries narrowed by atherosclerosis, blood flow decreases, causing insufficient blood supply to muscles, especially during exercise, and resulting in pain.

### Why Peripheral Artery Disease Matters

Peripheral artery disease is not just a leg problem but an indicator of vascular health throughout the body:

-   **Heart attack risk:** Heart attack risk increases 4-6 fold in PAD patients
-   **Stroke risk:** Brain vessels may also be affected
-   **Amputation risk:** Risk of limb loss in advanced cases
-   **Quality of life:** Walking difficulty seriously affects daily life
-   **Prevalence:** Affects 15-20% of individuals over 65 years old

## Stages of Peripheral Artery Disease

PAD is divided into four stages based on severity (Fontaine classification):

### Stage I: Asymptomatic

-   Patient feels no symptoms
-   Detected during examination or testing
-   Vessel narrowing exists but blood flow is adequate

### Stage II: Intermittent Claudication

-   Leg pain or cramping during walking
-   Pain resolves with rest
-   **IIa:** Able to walk more than 200 meters
-   **IIb:** Able to walk less than 200 meters

### Stage III: Rest Pain

-   Pain even without movement
-   Increases especially at night and when leg is elevated
-   Relieved when leg is lowered
-   Beginning of critical limb ischemia

### Stage IV: Tissue Loss

-   Impaired wound healing
-   Development of ulcers and gangrene
-   High risk of amputation
-   Requires urgent intervention

## Symptoms of Peripheral Artery Disease

PAD symptoms vary depending on the stage of disease and affected arteries:

### Classic Symptoms

-   **Intermittent claudication:** Pain, cramping, or fatigue in legs, hips, or calves while walking. Resolves within 5-10 minutes with rest
-   **Cold legs and feet:** Due to decreased blood flow
-   **Skin color changes:** Pale or bluish appearance
-   **Hair loss:** On legs and feet
-   **Nail changes:** Thickening and slow growth
-   **Weak pulse:** Weak or absent pulses in feet and legs
-   **Erectile dysfunction:** In men with pelvic artery involvement

### Advanced Stage Symptoms

-   Leg pain even at rest
-   Non-healing wounds (especially on feet and toes)
-   Gangrene (tissue death)
-   Numbness in leg or foot

{{< alert "danger" >}}
**Emergency Warning:** Sudden onset of severe leg pain, coldness, pallor, and numbness may indicate acute arterial occlusion. Call emergency services immediately! Without intervention within hours, there is risk of limb loss.
{{< /alert >}}

### Silent PAD

A significant portion of patients may have PAD without any symptoms. In diabetic patients, pain sensation may be reduced due to peripheral neuropathy. Therefore, regular screening is important for individuals with risk factors.

## Risk Factors

### Non-Modifiable Risk Factors

-   **Age:** Risk increases after 50, more pronounced after 65
-   **Gender:** More common in men, but prognosis is worse in women
-   **Genetics:** Family history of vascular disease
-   **Ethnicity:** More common in certain populations

### Modifiable Risk Factors

-   **Smoking:** Most important risk factor! Increases PAD risk 4-fold
-   **Diabetes:** Increases PAD risk 2-4 fold
-   **Hypertension:** Accelerates vascular damage
-   **High cholesterol:** Triggers atherosclerosis development
-   **Obesity:** Increases metabolic disorders
-   **Sedentary lifestyle:** Negatively affects vascular health

### Associated Conditions

-   Coronary artery disease
-   Carotid artery disease
-   Chronic kidney disease
-   Metabolic syndrome

## Diagnostic Methods

Peripheral artery disease diagnosis is made through clinical evaluation and various tests:

### Physical Examination

-   **Pulse check:** Evaluation of foot and leg pulses
-   **Skin assessment:** Color, temperature, and tissue changes
-   **Wound inspection:** Presence of ulcers or gangrene
-   **Auscultation:** Listening for bruits over vessels

### Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI)

-   Gold standard screening test for PAD diagnosis
-   Ratio of ankle to arm blood pressures
-   **Normal:** 1.0-1.4
-   **Mild PAD:** 0.9-0.99
-   **Moderate PAD:** 0.7-0.89
-   **Severe PAD:** 0.5-0.69
-   **Critical ischemia:** <0.5
-   Simple, painless, and inexpensive test

### Doppler Ultrasonography

-   Evaluates blood flow in vessels
-   Shows location of narrowing and blockage
-   Non-invasive and repeatable
-   Helps with treatment planning

### CT Angiography

-   3D imaging of vessel structure
-   For surgical and interventional planning
-   Requires contrast agent use
-   Kidney function should be evaluated

### MR Angiography

-   Radiation-free imaging
-   Detailed evaluation of vessel structure
-   Contrast agent may be needed in some patients
-   Caution needed in patients with pacemakers

### Conventional Angiography

-   Gold standard diagnostic method
-   Imaging from inside vessel via catheter
-   Treatment can be done in same session (balloon-stent)
-   Is an invasive procedure

### Exercise Testing

-   Measuring pain distance on treadmill
-   Evaluates functional capacity
-   Monitoring treatment effectiveness

## Treatment Approaches

PAD treatment is planned according to disease stage and patient's general condition. The main goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms, stop disease progression, and prevent complications.

### 1. Lifestyle Modifications

Fundamental treatment for all PAD patients:

**Smoking Cessation:**

-   Most critical step! Slows disease progression
-   Reduces amputation risk
-   Increases walking distance
-   Support programs and medications can help

**Exercise Program:**

-   Supervised walking programs
-   At least 3 times per week, 30-45 minutes
-   Rest when pain starts, continue when it passes
-   Can increase walking distance by 100-200%

**Nutrition:**

-   Heart-healthy diet
-   Saturated fat and salt restriction
-   Vegetables, fruits, and whole grains
-   Ideal weight goal

{{< alert "warning" >}}
**Important:** Smoking is the most important cause of PAD and rapidly advances the disease. Quitting smoking is essential for treatment success.

### 2. Medication Therapy

**Antiplatelet Therapy:**

-   Aspirin or clopidogrel
-   Prevents blood clotting
-   Reduces heart attack and stroke risk

**Cholesterol-Lowering Medications:**

-   Statins (atorvastatin, rosuvastatin)
-   LDL cholesterol target <70 mg/dL
-   Provides plaque stabilization
-   Reduces cardiovascular events

**Blood Pressure Medications:**

-   ACE inhibitors or ARBs
-   Target <130/80 mmHg
-   Vascular protective effect

**Diabetes Control:**

-   HbA1c target <7%
-   SGLT2 inhibitors provide cardiovascular protection

**Symptom-Relieving Medications:**

-   Cilostazol: Increases walking distance
-   Naftidrofuryl: Used in some countries
-   Prostaglandin analogs: In critical ischemia

### 3. Endovascular (Interventional) Treatment

Minimally invasive procedures performed from inside the vessel:

**Balloon Angioplasty:**

-   Widening the narrowing with balloon
-   Short hospital stay
-   Recurrent narrowing may occur

**Stent Placement:**

-   Metal cage to keep vessel open
-   Drug-coated stents are more effective
-   Preferred for long lesions

**Atherectomy:**

-   Mechanical removal of plaque
-   Used in calcified vessels
-   Can be combined with balloon and stent

### 4. Surgical Treatment

In advanced cases or when interventional treatment is not suitable:

**Bypass Surgery:**

-   Bypassing the blocked area
-   Use of vein or synthetic graft
-   Effective in long segment blockages
-   Longer recovery time

**Endarterectomy:**

-   Surgical removal of plaque
-   Can be applied in certain areas

**Amputation:**

-   Last resort treatment option
-   Can be life-saving
-   Rehabilitation is important

## Critical Limb Ischemia

Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the most severe form of peripheral artery disease and requires urgent intervention:

### Definition and Findings

-   Rest pain (lasting more than 2 weeks)
-   Wounds on feet or toes
-   Gangrene (tissue death)
-   ABI <0.4 or foot pressure <50 mmHg

### Treatment Approach

-   Urgent revascularization (vessel opening) is required
-   Endovascular or surgical treatment
-   Wound care and infection control
-   Rapid intervention is essential to prevent amputation

## Lifestyle Recommendations

Things to pay attention to when living with PAD:

### Foot Care

-   Check your feet every day
-   Look for cracks, wounds, or color changes
-   Wear appropriate shoes (not tight, comfortable)
-   Keep your feet warm but do not apply direct heat
-   Regular nail care (podiatrist recommended for diabetic patients)

### Exercise

-   Participate in a regular walking program
-   Stop when pain starts, continue when it passes
-   Gradually increase the distance
-   Exercise at least 3-5 days per week

### Nutrition

-   Follow a Mediterranean-type diet
-   Consume foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids
-   Reduce salt and saturated fat consumption
-   Eat plenty of vegetables and fruits
-   Avoid processed foods

### Medication Compliance

-   Take your medications regularly
-   Do not skip blood thinners
-   Do not miss your check-ups

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

{{< faq question="Does PAD completely heal?" >}}
Atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of PAD, is a chronic process and does not completely reverse. However, disease progression can be stopped, symptoms reduced, and amputation prevented with lifestyle changes, medication therapy, and interventional treatments when needed.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Should I exercise if walking causes pain?" >}}
Yes! Although it seems like a paradox, regular walking programs are one of the cornerstones of PAD treatment. Stop and rest when pain starts, continue walking when it passes. With this "stop-start" method, your vessels develop new connections (collaterals) to increase blood flow.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="What is the relationship between smoking and PAD?" >}}
Smoking is the most important risk factor for PAD and rapidly advances the disease. Smokers have 4 times more PAD risk than non-smokers. Quitting smoking is the most critical step in treatment and can change the course of the disease on its own.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Does PAD cause heart attacks?" >}}
PAD is an indicator of atherosclerosis throughout the body. More than 50% of patients diagnosed with PAD also have coronary artery disease. Therefore, PAD patients are at high risk for heart attack and stroke, and cardiac health monitoring is required.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Is stent or bypass better?" >}}
Both treatments have advantages and disadvantages. The decision is made individually based on the location and length of the blockage, patient's general condition, and accompanying diseases. Endovascular treatment may be preferred for short segment blockages, and bypass for long segments and multiple blockages.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="How does diabetes affect PAD?" >}}
Diabetes increases PAD risk 2-4 fold and negatively affects disease course. Pain sensation may be reduced in diabetic patients due to peripheral neuropathy, which may cause delayed diagnosis. Additionally, wound healing is impaired and infection risk increases.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Why is foot care important in PAD?" >}}
Due to reduced blood flow in PAD, even small wounds have difficulty healing and are prone to infection. Unnoticed foot wounds can progress to gangrene. Therefore, daily foot inspection, proper footwear selection, and regular care are vitally important.
{{< /faq >}}

{{< faq question="Can PAD be prevented?" >}}
PAD is largely a preventable disease. PAD risk can be significantly reduced by not smoking, regular exercise, healthy nutrition, blood pressure and cholesterol control, and diabetes management. Early control of risk factors is critically important.
