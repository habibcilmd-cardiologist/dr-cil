    - question: "Is tricuspid regurgitation dangerous?"
      answer: "Severe tricuspid regurgitation can lead to right heart failure. Treatment is important."
    - question: "What are the symptoms of tricuspid valve disease?"
      answer: "Leg swelling, abdominal swelling, fatigue, and shortness of breath are the main symptoms."
    - question: "How is tricuspid regurgitation treated?"
      answer: "Medical treatment, surgical repair or replacement, transcatheter interventions can be applied."
    - question: "Is tricuspid valve surgery risky?"
      answer: "Isolated tricuspid surgery is high risk. Therefore, transcatheter treatments are being developed."

Tricuspid valve disease is dysfunction of the valve between the right atrium and right ventricle. Tricuspid regurgitation is most common. Modern transcatheter interventions offer promising treatment options for patients who are high risk for surgery.

## What is Tricuspid Valve Disease?

The tricuspid valve regulates blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle. In valve disease, this function is impaired and creates additional burden on the right heart.

**Types of Tricuspid Valve Disease:**

-   Tricuspid regurgitation
-   Tricuspid stenosis - rare
-   Combined tricuspid valve disease

## Tricuspid Regurgitation

### Causes

**Primary (Organic):**

-   Endocarditis
-   Rheumatic disease
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Trauma
-   Congenital anomalies

**Secondary (Functional):**

-   Left heart disease
-   Pulmonary hypertension
-   Right ventricular dilation
-   Atrial fibrillation

### Symptoms

-   Leg swelling
-   Abdominal swelling (ascites)
-   Fatigue
-   Shortness of breath
-   Neck vein distension

### Grading

| Grade    | Vena Contracta | Regurgitant Volume |
| -------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Mild     | <3 mm          | <15 ml             |
| Moderate | 3-6.9 mm       | 15-29 ml           |
| Severe   | ≥7 mm          | ≥30 ml             |
| Massive  | >14 mm         | >45 ml             |

## Tricuspid Stenosis

### Causes

-   Rheumatic disease
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Congenital

### Symptoms

-   Right heart failure signs
-   Hepatomegaly
-   Ascites

## Tricuspid Valve Disease Diagnosis

### Physical Examination

-   Systolic murmur (regurgitation)
-   Diastolic murmur (stenosis)
-   Neck vein distension
-   Hepatomegaly

### Imaging

-   Transthoracic echocardiography
-   Transesophageal echocardiography
-   Cardiac MRI
-   Right heart catheterization

## Tricuspid Valve Disease Treatment

### Medical Treatment

-   Diuretics
-   Sodium restriction
-   Treatment of underlying disease
-   Heart failure treatment

### Surgical Treatment

**Tricuspid Valve Repair:**

-   Annuloplasty ring
-   Preferred method

**Tricuspid Valve Replacement:**

-   If repair not possible
-   Bioprosthetic valve preferred

### Interventional Treatment

**Transcatheter Tricuspid Interventions:**

Modern treatment methods developed for patients who are high risk for surgery, performed via catheter from the groin without opening the chest.

**1. TriClip (Edge-to-Edge Repair):**
It is the adaptation of the MitraClip technology used for the mitral valve to the tricuspid valve. It is an approved method for patients with high surgical risk.

-   **How it Works:** The heart is accessed via the groin and the tricuspid valve leaflets are clipped together.
-   **Mechanism of Action:** The valve opening is reduced by the "clipping" method, reducing backward leakage (regurgitation).
-   **Advantage:** It is a non-surgical, minimally invasive method. Detailed studies show safety and improved quality of life in high-risk patients.

**2. PASCAL System:**
It is an "edge-to-edge repair" system similar to TriClip but with a different design.

-   **Difference:** It contains a "spacer" placed between the leaflets. This design reduces stress on the leaflets and provides a larger grasping surface.
-   **Usage Area:** It may be preferred in anatomies with a wide gap between leaflets or where leaflets are very mobile.

**3. Emerging Technologies:**
This field is advancing rapidly with devices having different mechanisms:

-   **Caval Valve Implantation (CAVI):** This method does not repair the tricuspid valve itself; instead, it places valve(s) in the Vena Cava (main veins).

    -   **Goal:** To relieve symptoms like swelling (edema) by preventing backflow to the liver and legs.
    -   **For Whom:** Used for "palliative" (symptomatic relief) purposes in patients with very high surgical risk who are anatomically unsuitable for valve repair/replacement.

-   **Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Replacement (TTVI / TTVR):** Complete replacement of the dysfunctional valve with a new artificial bioprosthetic valve via catheter.
    -   **Status:** Advanced systems like Evoque and LuX-Valve are available. It allows for complete valve renewal in patients who are functionally or anatomically unsuitable for repair. Clinical trials are showing promising results.

## Treatment Timing

Treatment decision depends on:

-   Presence of symptoms
-   Right ventricular function
-   Accompanying left heart surgery
-   Pulmonary pressure
