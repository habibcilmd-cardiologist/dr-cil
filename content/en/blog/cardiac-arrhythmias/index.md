faq:
- question: Is every palpitation dangerous?
  answer: No, most palpitations are harmless. Conditions like stress, caffeine, exercise,
    or anxiety can cause temporary palpitations. However, palpitations that are frequent,
    prolonged, or accompanied by fainting or chest pain should always be evaluated.
- question: Is atrial fibrillation life-threatening?
  answer: AF is not directly life-threatening, but its complications can be serious.
    The most important risk is clots forming in the atria traveling to the brain and
    causing stroke. Therefore, blood thinner therapy is very important in appropriate
    patients. Additionally, uncontrolled AF can lead to heart failure over time.
- question: Can I live normally after getting a pacemaker?
  answer: Yes, the vast majority of patients with pacemakers can lead normal, active
    lives. Although there are some restrictions (MRI machines, strong magnetic fields),
    daily activities and even sports are generally possible. Regular check-ups and
    device monitoring are important.
- question: How effective is ablation therapy?
  answer: Ablation success varies by arrhythmia type. In SVTs (AVNRT, AVRT), success
    rate is 95-98% and permanent cure is usually achieved in a single session. In
    AF ablation, success is around 70-80% and sometimes multiple procedures may be
    needed.
- question: Are arrhythmias hereditary?
  answer: Some arrhythmias are associated with genetic predisposition. Conditions
    like Long QT syndrome, Brugada syndrome, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can run
    in families. If there's a family history of sudden death or arrhythmia at a young
    age, genetic screening may be recommended.
- question: Can coffee and alcohol cause arrhythmias?
  answer: Excessive caffeine and alcohol consumption can trigger arrhythmias. Alcohol
    is particularly an important trigger in AF patients. Coffee may cause palpitations
    in some people depending on individual sensitivity. Moderate consumption is generally
    recommended.
- question: Does an ICD shock hurt?
  answer: Yes, ICD shock is felt and some patients describe it as a strong kick or
    electric shock. However, this shock is life-saving and terminates ventricular
    fibrillation. Device programming and medication therapy are optimized to prevent
    inappropriate shocks.
- question: How is arrhythmia treated during pregnancy?
  answer: Arrhythmia treatment during pregnancy requires special attention. Most antiarrhythmic
    drugs carry risk for the fetus. Beta blockers are relatively safe. Anticoagulation
    in AF requires special protocols. Ablation is generally postponed until before
    or after pregnancy. Each case should be evaluated individually.

Cardiac arrhythmias are conditions that develop when the heart's normal electrical conduction system is disrupted. The heart may beat too fast, too slow, or irregularly. This comprehensive guide examines different types of arrhythmias, their symptoms, diagnostic methods, and current treatment options.

## What is a Cardiac Arrhythmia?

Normal heart rhythm is regulated by electrical impulses originating from the sinus node. These impulses spread to the heart chambers, enabling coordinated contraction. Normal resting heart rate is 60-100 beats per minute.

Arrhythmia is the irregularity, acceleration, or slowing of heart rhythm due to disturbances in this electrical system. Arrhythmias can range from harmless palpitations to life-threatening conditions.

### The Heart's Electrical Conduction System

**Sinus Node (SA Node)**

-   The heart's natural pacemaker
-   Located in the right atrium
-   Initiates normal rhythm (60-100/min)

**Atrioventricular Node (AV Node)**

-   Provides conduction from atria to ventricles
-   Acts as a gateway
-   Slows conduction for coordination

**Bundle of His and Purkinje Fibers**

-   Rapid conduction to ventricles
-   Enables coordinated contraction

## Types of Arrhythmias

Arrhythmias are classified by heart rate and origin:

### Classification by Rate

**Tachycardia (Fast Heart Rate)**

-   Heart rate > 100 beats/minute
-   Sinus tachycardia, SVT, VT, AF

**Bradycardia (Slow Heart Rate)**

-   Heart rate < 60 beats/minute
-   Sinus bradycardia, AV blocks, sick sinus syndrome

### Classification by Origin

**Supraventricular Arrhythmias (Atrial Origin)**

_Atrial Fibrillation (AF)_

-   Most common sustained arrhythmia
-   Irregular, rapid atrial contractions
-   Increased stroke risk
-   Palpitations, shortness of breath, fatigue

_Atrial Flutter_

-   Regular but rapid circuit in atria
-   Usually 300/min atrial rate
-   Similar symptoms to AF

_Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT)_

-   Sudden onset and termination
-   Heart rate 150-250/min
-   Usually benign
-   AVNRT, AVRT, atrial tachycardia

_Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs)_

-   Early atrial beats
-   Often harmless
-   Sensation of palpitations

**Ventricular Arrhythmias**

_Ventricular Tachycardia (VT)_

-   Rapid rhythm originating from ventricles
-   Can be life-threatening
-   Associated with structural heart disease
-   Sustained VT requires emergency intervention

_Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)_

-   Most dangerous arrhythmia
-   Heart stops pumping
-   Cause of sudden cardiac death
-   Requires immediate defibrillation

_Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVCs)_

-   Early ventricular beats
-   Usually harmless
-   Frequent PVCs should be evaluated

### Conduction Disorders

**AV Blocks**

-   _First Degree:_ PR prolongation, usually harmless
-   _Second Degree (Mobitz I/II):_ Some beats not conducted
-   _Third Degree (Complete block):_ Atrial-ventricular connection severed, requires pacemaker

**Bundle Branch Blocks**

-   Left bundle branch block (LBBB)
-   Right bundle branch block (RBBB)
-   Fascicular blocks

## Causes and Risk Factors

### Cardiac Causes

-   Coronary artery disease and heart attack
-   Heart failure
-   Heart valve diseases

### Non-Cardiac Causes

-   Electrolyte imbalances (potassium, magnesium)
-   Thyroid disorders
-   Medications and toxic substances

## Arrhythmia Symptoms

Symptoms of arrhythmias vary depending on type, duration, and heart function:

### Common Symptoms

-   May worsen with exertion

**Chest Pain or Discomfort**

-   Heart working excessively
-   May indicate coronary insufficiency

**Fatigue and Weakness**

-   Due to low cardiac output
-   Exercise intolerance

-   Prevention of sudden cardiac death
-   Detects and terminates VT/VF
-   Primary or secondary prevention

**CRT (Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy)**

-   Heart failure + left bundle branch block
-   Provides synchronized contraction
-   As CRT-P or CRT-D

### Electrical Cardioversion
