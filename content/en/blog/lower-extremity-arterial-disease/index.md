faq:
- question: "Why does leg pain occur while walking?"
  answer: "Due to narrowing of leg arteries, muscles cannot receive adequate oxygenated blood during exercise, causing cramp-like pain (claudication)."
- question: "Can peripheral artery disease be treated?"
  answer: "Yes, it can be successfully treated with lifestyle changes (quitting smoking, walking), medication, and angiographic procedures (balloon/stent) to open the vessels."
- question: "Does walking distance increase after stenting?"
  answer: "Yes, after vessel patency is restored, blood flow improves and patients' walking distance significantly increases; they can walk without pain."
- question: "What is critical limb ischemia?"
  answer: "It is the advanced stage of the disease. It is characterized by pain even at rest, non-healing foot wounds, or discoloration/gangrene in toes. It requires urgent intervention."
- question: "Should smoking be stopped?"
  answer: "Absolutely. Smoking is the most important cause of vascular blockage. Continuing to smoke after treatment significantly increases the risk of re-occlusion."

Lower Extremity Arterial Disease (LEAD) is commonly known as "leg artery blockage." This condition, which manifests especially with leg pain that comes on with walking (window shopper's disease), can lead to serious consequences up to limb loss if left untreated. Interventional Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil provides detailed information about non-surgical treatment (balloon and stent) of leg vessel blockages.

## What is Lower Extremity Arterial Disease?

Lower extremity arterial disease is the narrowing or complete blockage of arteries carrying clean blood to the legs due to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries). Cholesterol, fat, and calcium layers (plaque) accumulating in the vessel wall obstruct blood flow and impair the nutrition of leg muscles.

**Commonly Affected Vessels:**
*   Aortoiliac segment (Abdomen and groin vessels)
*   Femoral arteries (Thigh vessels)
*   Popliteal artery (Vessel behind the knee)
*   Tibial arteries (Vessels below the knee)

## Causes and Risk Factors

The most important factors leading to vascular blockage are:

*   **Smoking (Biggest risk factor)**
*   Diabetes
*   Hypertension (High blood pressure)
*   High cholesterol (Hyperlipidemia)
*   Advanced age
*   Obesity and sedentary lifestyle

## What are the Symptoms?

The disease can progress silently. The most typical symptom is walking pain called **claudication**.

### 1. Claudication (Intermittent Limping)
*   Cramp-like pain starts in the calf, thigh, or buttocks after walking a certain distance.
*   The pain resolves within 1-2 minutes when the patient stops and rests.
*   Pain recurs at the same distance when walking starts again ("Window Shopper's Disease").

### 2. Critical Limb Ischemia (Advanced Stage)
As the disease progresses, vessels become more severely blocked and symptoms worsen:
*   **Rest Pain:** Severe pain in the leg or foot while lying down at night; the patient tries to relieve relief by hanging the leg down from the bed.
*   **Foot Wounds:** Spontaneous and non-healing wounds on toes or heel.
*   **Gangrene:** Discoloration and blackening (tissue death) in toes.

If there is a non-healing wound, rest pain, or discoloration in toes, there is a **risk of limb loss**. A vascular specialist should be consulted immediately.

## Diagnostic Methods

*   **Physical Examination:** Pulse check in legs.
*   **ABI (Ankle-Brachial Index):** Comparison of arm and ankle blood pressures.
*   **Doppler Ultrasonography:** Visualization of blood flow with sound waves.
*   **CT Angiography:** Used for detailed mapping of vessels.

## Treatment Methods

The goal of treatment is to increase walking distance, relieve pain, and prevent limb loss.

### 1. Lifestyle and Medical Treatment
Basic treatment in early stages and for all patients:
*   Strict cessation of smoking.
*   Regular walking exercises (Develops collateral vessel network).
*   Blood thinners and cholesterol-lowering drugs.
*   Diabetes and blood pressure control.

### 2. Endovascular (Non-Surgical) Treatment
Today, most patients can be treated with angiographic methods without incision or general anesthesia. The procedure is performed through the groin with local anesthesia.

*   **Balloon Angioplasty:** Special balloons are inflated in the narrowed area to widen the vessel.
*   **Stenting:** A metal mesh (stent) is placed if the balloon is insufficient or to prevent re-narrowing.
*   **Drug-Coated Balloon/Stent:** Drug-eluting technologies are used to minimize the risk of re-occlusion.
*   **Atherectomy (Shaving):** Calcified plaques inside the vessel are shaved and cleared with special devices.

### 3. Surgical Treatment
In very long or complete blockages where endovascular method is not suitable, **Bypass surgery** (bridging with an artificial vessel or patient's own vein) may be required.
