faq:
- question: "Why do varicose veins form?"
  answer: "Varicose veins form when the valves that prevent blood from flowing backward in leg veins malfunction, causing blood to pool and veins to dilate."
- question: "Is varicose vein treatment permanent?"
  answer: "Yes, vessels treated with modern methods (laser, foam) are permanently closed or removed. However, since genetic predisposition persists, new varicose veins may form in other vessels if preventive measures are not taken."
- question: "Are compression stockings necessary?"
  answer: "Yes, compression stockings support the leg muscle pump and facilitate upward blood flow. Their use is very important both during the treatment process and for prevention."
- question: "Is laser treatment painful?"
  answer: "No, the procedure is performed under local anesthesia (tumescent anesthesia). The patient feels no pain during the procedure and can walk home immediately afterward."
- question: "When can I return to work after treatment?"
  answer: "After non-surgical methods like laser or foam treatment, patients can usually return to normal work life within 1-2 days, sometimes even the same day."

Venous insufficiency, commonly known as **Varicose Vein Disease**, is not just a cosmetic problem but a serious circulatory disorder that impairs quality of life. Manifesting with pain, heaviness, and swelling in the legs, this condition can now be treated comfortably with modern methods like laser and radiofrequency without the need for surgery.

## What is Venous Insufficiency?

Veins are vessels that carry dirty blood from the legs back to the heart against gravity. Inside these veins are one-way valves that prevent blood from flowing backward. When these valves malfunction, blood pools downward due to gravity, and pressure inside the vein increases. This condition is called **Chronic Venous Insufficiency**, and the enlarged, tortuous veins are called **Varicose Veins**.

## Causes and Risk Factors

*   **Genetic Predisposition:** Risk is high in those with a family history of varicose veins.
*   **Prolonged Standing:** Common in professions requiring long periods of standing (teachers, hairdressers, surgeons, etc.).
*   **Female Gender and Pregnancy:** Hormonal effects and pregnancy relax vein structure, increasing risk.
*   **Aging:** Decreased vein elasticity.
*   **Obesity:** Increases intra-abdominal pressure, making blood return difficult.
*   **Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT):** Past leg clots can damage valves.

## What are the Symptoms?

### Early Stage Complaints
*   Leg pain and heaviness increasing towards the end of the day.
*   Swelling in legs (Edema).
*   Night cramps.
*   Itching and tingling.

### Advanced Stage Findings
*   Visibly thick, twisted green/purple veins (Varicose packs).
*   Darkening of skin color at the ankle (brown discoloration).
*   Hardening of the skin (Lipodermatosclerosis).
*   Non-healing ankle wounds (Venous Ulcer).

## Diagnostic Methods

Diagnosis is made with a detailed **Color Doppler Ultrasonography**. This test determines:
*   Which vessel has leakage (reflux),
*   The degree and duration of leakage,
*   The condition of deep veins,
*   Presence of clots.

## Treatment Methods

Treatment is planned according to the degree of insufficiency and the patient's complaints.

### 1. Preventive (Conservative) Treatment
Used in mild cases and for prevention:
*   **Compression Stockings:** Apply external pressure to help veins empty.
*   **Lifestyle:** Weight loss, regular walking, avoiding prolonged standing.
*   **Venotonic Drugs:** Medication to strengthen vein walls and reduce symptoms.

### 2. Endovenous (Non-Surgical) Treatments
These are the "gold standard" treatment methods today. Treatment is applied from within the vein without incision.

*   **Laser (EVLA) and Radiofrequency (RFA):** A thin fiber/catheter is placed inside the leaking main vein. Heat energy is applied to burn and close the vein from the inside. The closed vein is absorbed by the body over time.
    *   **Advantages:** Performed under local anesthesia, painless, leaves no scar, patient is discharged immediately by walking.
*   **Biological Glue:** The vein is closed by injecting a special medical glue. Anesthesia is not required as heat is not used.

### 3. Sclerotherapy (Needle/Foam Treatment)
Used mostly for treatment of superficial spider veins and medium-sized varicose veins. Medication is injected into the vein with very fine needles to dry it out. Also known as "foam treatment." Aesthetic results are quite successful.

### 4. Surgical Treatment (Stripping)
With the development of modern methods, it is now preferred very rarely, only in cases with excessively enlarged and tortuous packs.
