faq:
- question: "Is abdominal aortic aneurysm dangerous?"
  answer: "Yes, it can be life-threatening due to rupture risk. Regular follow-up and timely treatment are important."
- question: "What are the symptoms of aneurysm?"
  answer: "Most aneurysms are asymptomatic. Abdominal pain, back pain, or pulsating sensation may occur."
- question: "What is EVAR?"
  answer: "EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair) is a minimally invasive (non-surgical) aneurysm repair procedure where a stent-graft is placed through the groin."
- question: "When should aneurysm be treated?"
  answer: "Treatment is usually recommended for aneurysms over 5.5 cm or those growing rapidly."
- question: "What is life like after aneurysm treatment?"
  answer: "After successful treatment, you can return to normal life. Regular follow-up is required."

Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) is the abnormal enlargement of the aorta, the body's main artery, in the abdominal region. Often progressing silently and known as the "silent killer," this condition poses a life-threatening risk if it ruptures. Interventional Cardiologist Assoc. Prof. Dr. Habib Çil explains what you need to know about early diagnosis, monitoring of AAA, and the non-surgical treatment method, EVAR.

## What is Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm?

Abdominal aortic aneurysm is the enlargement of the abdominal portion of the aorta (abdominal aorta), the main vessel carrying clean blood from the heart to the entire body, to more than 1.5 times its normal diameter. The normal abdominal aortic diameter is approximately 2 cm; a diameter of 3 cm or more is considered an aneurysm.

**Aneurysm Classification:**

*   **Small:** 3-4.4 cm
*   **Medium:** 4.5-5.4 cm
*   **Large:** ≥5.5 cm

## Causes and Risk Factors

### Risk Factors

*   **Smoking (Most important risk factor)**
*   Hypertension (High blood pressure)
*   Atherosclerosis (Hardening of the arteries)
*   Family history (Genetic predisposition)
*   Advanced age (>65 years)
*   Male gender

### Other Causes

*   Infections
*   Trauma
*   Connective tissue diseases (Marfan syndrome, etc.)
*   Vasculitis (Inflammation of blood vessels)

## Symptoms of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm

Abdominal aortic aneurysm usually causes **no symptoms** and is discovered incidentally during an ultrasound or CT scan performed for another reason.

### Symptomatic Aneurysms

*   **Abdominal or back pain:** Constant, gnawing pain.
*   **Pulsating Sensation:** A strong pulsating feeling in the abdomen, especially around the navel, matching your heartbeat.
*   **Palpable Mass:** In thin patients, a mass beating like a heart can be felt in the abdomen.

### Rupture Symptoms (Emergency)

Rupture of the aneurysm is a life-threatening emergency. Symptoms include:

*   Sudden severe abdominal or back pain
*   Low blood pressure (Hypotension)
*   Cold sweats, feeling of faintness (Signs of shock)
*   Loss of consciousness

If you experience severe abdominal pain and a feeling of fainting, call **Emergency Services** immediately or go to the nearest hospital without delay.

## Diagnostic Methods

*   **Ultrasonography:** The most commonly used, radiation-free method for screening and follow-up.
*   **CT Angiography (Computed Tomography):** The **gold standard** for diagnosis and treatment planning. It provides the clearest view of the vessel diameter, structure, and suitability for treatment.
*   **MR Angiography:** May be preferred in patients with kidney failure.

### Who Should Get Screened?

*   Men aged 65-75 who have smoked
*   Individuals with a family history of aortic aneurysm

## Treatment Methods

The treatment decision is based on the aneurysm's diameter, growth rate, and the patient's symptoms.

### 1. Surveillance
**Small Aneurysms (<5.5 cm):** Do not require interventional procedure. Followed up with ultrasound or CT at 6-12 month intervals. Quitting smoking and controlling blood pressure is crucial during this process.

### 2. Endovascular Treatment (EVAR)
**EVAR (Endovascular Aneurysm Repair):** The most preferred, non-surgical treatment method today.
*   **How is it done?** A stent-graft (artificial vessel) is placed inside the aneurysm through a small incision or needle puncture in the groin.
*   **Advantages:** Recovery time is very short, hospital stay is minimal, and general anesthesia may not be required.

### 3. Surgical Treatment
**Open Surgical Repair:** The traditional method used if the patient's vascular anatomy is not suitable for EVAR. The abdomen is opened, and the enlarged vessel section is replaced with an artificial vessel. Recovery time is longer compared to EVAR.

## Treatment Indications (When to Treat?)

*   Aneurysm diameter **≥5.5 cm** in men, **≥5.0 cm** in women
*   Growth of more than 0.5 cm in 6 months
*   Presence of symptoms (pain)
