    - question: "Does everyone with valve disease need surgery?"
      answer: "No. Mild-moderate valve diseases can be managed with medication and monitoring. Surgery is needed when there's severe disease and symptoms."
    - question: "Should mechanical or biological valve be preferred?"
      answer: "Depends on age, lifestyle, and ability to take anticoagulants. Mechanical preferred in young patients, biological in elderly. Make the decision together with your doctor."
    - question: "Is TAVI safer than surgery?"
      answer: "TAVI is safer than open surgery in high-risk patients. However, surgery remains the gold standard in low-risk young patients. Risk assessment should be individualized."
    - question: "Can I return to normal life after valve surgery?"
      answer: "Yes! Most patients return to normal activities within 6-12 weeks after surgery. Regular follow-up and medication compliance are important."
    - question: "How long does a prosthetic valve last?"
      answer: "Mechanical valves last 20-30 years or more. Biological valves last 10-20 years and may need replacement afterward."
    - question: "Is valve disease hereditary?"
      answer: "Some valve diseases (bicuspid aortic valve, mitral valve prolapse) show genetic predisposition. Screening is recommended if there's family history of valve disease."

Heart valve diseases occur when one or more of the heart's four valves don't function properly. Valves can become narrowed (stenosis), fail to close completely (regurgitation), or both. With early diagnosis and appropriate treatment, the vast majority of patients can continue their normal lives. In this article, I'll discuss the types of heart valve diseases, symptoms, diagnostic methods, and current treatment options in detail.

## Heart Valves and Their Functions

The heart consists of four chambers (two atria, two ventricles) and four valves. Valves act as one-way gates that ensure blood flows in one direction:

### Aortic Valve

-   Located between the left ventricle and aorta (main artery)
-   Controls blood pumping to the body
-   Most commonly affected valve

### Mitral Valve

-   Located between the left atrium and left ventricle
-   Allows passage of oxygenated blood from the lungs
-   Second most commonly affected valve

### Tricuspid Valve

-   Located between the right atrium and right ventricle
-   Allows passage of deoxygenated blood returning from the body

### Pulmonary Valve

-   Located between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery
-   Controls blood pumping to the lungs

## Types of Heart Valve Diseases

Valve diseases are examined in two main categories:

### Valve Stenosis

Valve leaflets stiffen or fuse, restricting opening. Blood flow becomes difficult and the heart must work harder.

**Aortic Stenosis:**

-   Most common valve disease
-   Due to aging, calcification, or congenital bicuspid valve
-   Severe cases cause chest pain, fainting, shortness of breath
-   Can be fatal within 2-3 years if untreated

**Mitral Stenosis:**

-   Usually develops after rheumatic fever
-   Still common in Turkey
-   Shortness of breath, palpitations, atrial fibrillation risk

### Valve Regurgitation

Valve doesn't close completely, blood leaks backward. Heart must pump both forward and backward.

**Mitral Regurgitation:**

-   Most common valve regurgitation
-   Mitral valve prolapse, ischemic heart disease, infective endocarditis
-   Fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations

**Aortic Regurgitation:**

-   Aortic valve doesn't close completely
-   Hypertension, aortic root dilation, infection
-   Palpitations, shortness of breath, chest pain

**Tricuspid Regurgitation:**

-   Usually secondary to left heart diseases
-   Leg swelling, abdominal swelling, fatigue

## Causes of Heart Valve Diseases

### Degenerative (Age-Related)

-   Stiffening and calcification of valve leaflets with age
-   Most common cause especially in aortic stenosis
-   Frequency increases after age 65

### Rheumatic Heart Disease

-   After untreated streptococcal throat infection
-   Particularly affects the mitral valve
-   Still an important cause in developing countries
-   Continues to be seen in Turkey, though decreasing

### Congenital

-   Bicuspid aortic valve (two leaflets)
-   Two leaflets instead of normal three
-   Early aortic stenosis or regurgitation

### Infective Endocarditis

-   Bacterial infection on the valve
-   Intravenous drug use, dental infections, prosthetic heart valve
-   Requires emergency treatment

### Myocardial Infarction (Heart Attack)

-   Mitral regurgitation due to papillary muscle damage
-   Can be acute or chronic

### Other Causes

-   Marfan syndrome
-   Systemic lupus erythematosus
-   Carcinoid syndrome
-   Radiation therapy
-   Certain medications

## Symptoms

Valve diseases may not cause symptoms for a long time when progressing slowly. Symptoms usually appear as the disease advances:

### Common Symptoms

-   **Shortness of breath:** During exertion or when lying down
-   **Fatigue:** Unusual weakness
-   **Palpitations:** Irregular or rapid heartbeat
-   **Chest pain:** Especially during exertion
-   **Dizziness or fainting:** Especially in aortic stenosis
-   **Ankle swelling:** Sign of right heart failure

### Serious Symptoms (Require Emergency Care)

-   Sudden and severe shortness of breath
-   Fainting with chest pain
-   Pink frothy sputum (pulmonary edema)
-   Fever with new murmur (endocarditis suspicion)

## Diagnostic Methods

### Physical Examination

-   Listening to heart sounds with stethoscope
-   Detection of murmur
-   Location, timing, and intensity of murmur evaluated

### Echocardiography (Heart Ultrasound)

The cornerstone of diagnosis:

-   **Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE):** Done through chest wall
-   **Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE):** Through esophagus, more detailed imaging
-   Valve structure, movement, degree of stenosis/regurgitation
-   Heart chamber sizes and function
-   Pulmonary pressure estimation

### Electrocardiogram (ECG)

-   Heart rhythm assessment
-   Atrial fibrillation detection
-   Left ventricular hypertrophy findings

### Chest X-ray

-   Heart size
-   Pulmonary congestion
-   Valve calcification

### Cardiac MRI

-   Detailed heart structure and function
-   Precise measurement of regurgitation volume
-   Myocardial fibrosis assessment

### Cardiac Catheterization

-   Coronary artery disease evaluation (before surgery)
-   Pressure measurements
-   Definitive determination of stenosis degree

## Treatment Approaches

Treatment is determined based on disease type, severity, and patient condition:

### Medical Treatment (Medication)

Doesn't treat valve disease but controls symptoms:

-   **Diuretics:** Reduce fluid accumulation
-   **Beta blockers:** Control heart rate
-   **ACE inhibitors/ARBs:** Lower blood pressure
-   **Anticoagulants:** Prevent clot formation (especially in AF)
-   **Antiarrhythmics:** Control rhythm disorders

### Surgical Valve Repair

Preferred when possible, especially for mitral valve:

**Advantages:**

-   Own valve is preserved
-   Anticoagulant need is reduced
-   Better long-term outcomes

**Repair Techniques:**

-   Valve ring (annuloplasty)
-   Leaflet repair
-   Chordae repair or transfer

### Surgical Valve Replacement

Valve is replaced when repair isn't possible:

**Mechanical Valves:**

-   Durable, long-lasting (20-30+ years)
-   Requires lifelong anticoagulation (warfarin)
-   Preferred in younger patients

**Biological (Tissue) Valves:**

-   From pig or cow tissue
-   No anticoagulation required (except first 3-6 months)
-   Lasts 10-20 years, may degenerate afterward
-   Preferred in elderly or those who can't take anticoagulants

### Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI/TAVR)

Aortic valve replacement without open heart surgery:

-   Done via catheter through groin or chest
-   For high-risk or inoperable patients
-   Increasingly used in younger patients
-   Short hospital stay (2-5 days)
-   Rapid recovery

**Indications:**

-   Severe aortic stenosis
-   High surgical risk
-   Patients over 75 (expanding)

### Transcatheter Mitral Valve Interventions

-   **MitraClip:** Joining mitral valve leaflets in mitral regurgitation
-   **Transcatheter mitral valve replacement:** Developing technology

### Balloon Valvuloplasty

-   Widening narrowed valve with catheter
-   Effective in mitral stenosis (especially rheumatic)
-   Temporary solution in aortic stenosis (bridge to TAVI)

## Post-Operative Care

### Early Period

-   Intensive care monitoring
-   Pain control
-   Early mobilization
-   Breathing exercises
-   Wound care

### Long-Term Follow-up

-   Regular cardiology check-ups
-   Valve function monitoring with echocardiography
-   Anticoagulant monitoring (INR control for mechanical valve)
-   Endocarditis prophylaxis

### Endocarditis Prophylaxis

Antibiotics before certain procedures in patients with prosthetic valves:

-   Dental procedures (those causing gum bleeding)
-   Certain surgical procedures
-   Always inform your doctor about your prosthetic valve

## Lifestyle Recommendations

### Physical Activity

-   Light-moderate exercise generally safe
-   Avoid heavy lifting and competitive sports
-   Determine exercise program with your doctor

### Nutrition

-   Salt restriction (especially if heart failure present)
-   Healthy, balanced diet
-   Watch vitamin K-containing foods with mechanical valve (warfarin interaction)

### Dental Health

-   Regular dental check-ups
-   Good oral hygiene
-   Consult your doctor before dental procedures

### Pregnancy

-   Women with valve disease should be evaluated before pregnancy
-   Mechanical valve and anticoagulant management requires special attention
-   High-risk pregnancy monitoring
