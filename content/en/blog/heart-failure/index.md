faq:
- question: Can heart failure be completely cured?
  answer: Heart failure is usually a chronic condition and cannot be completely cured.
    However, with proper treatment, symptoms can be controlled, disease progression
    can be slowed, and quality of life can be significantly improved. In some cases
    (such as when caused by a temporary condition), ejection fraction may return to
    normal.
- question: Can I exercise with heart failure?
  answer: Yes, regular, moderate-intensity exercise is recommended for stable heart
    failure patients. Cardiac rehabilitation programs are particularly beneficial.
    It's important to plan your exercise program with your doctor. Gradually increase
    your activity without overexertion.
- question: How much fluid should I drink?
  answer: Generally, 1.5-2 liters of daily fluid intake is recommended. However, this
    amount may vary depending on your disease severity and diuretic use. Your doctor
    will determine specific fluid restrictions for you. Daily weight monitoring is
    the best way to track your fluid balance.
- question: Can I use salt with heart failure?
  answer: Salt restriction is a cornerstone of heart failure treatment. Daily sodium
    intake below 2 grams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) is recommended. Prepared foods,
    canned products, and restaurant meals typically contain high sodium levels.
- question: Do I have to take heart failure medications for life?
  answer: Most heart failure medications need to be taken long-term or for life. These
    medications don't just control symptoms; they also slow disease progression and
    extend life. Even if you feel well, don't stop your medications without consulting
    your doctor.
- question: When is a pacemaker or shock device (ICD) needed?
  answer: ICD is recommended for patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death. It's
    typically implanted in patients with ejection fraction at or below 35% despite
    optimal medical therapy and NYHA class II-III symptoms. CRT (cardiac resynchronization
    therapy) enables synchronized heart function in patients with left bundle branch
    block and low EF.
- question: When is heart transplant considered?
  answer: Heart transplantation is considered in end-stage heart failure patients
    whose symptoms cannot be controlled despite all medical and device therapies.
    For patients not eligible for transplant, LVAD (left ventricular assist device)
    may be an alternative.
- question: Can I prevent heart failure?
  answer: 'Yes, you can significantly reduce your risk by controlling the main causes
    of heart failure: - Keep your blood pressure under control - Monitor your cholesterol
    regularly - Eat healthy and maintain ideal weight - Exercise regularly - Avoid
    smoking - Limit alcohol consumption - If you have diabetes, keep it well controlled'

Heart failure is a condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Affecting millions worldwide, this chronic condition can be managed with early diagnosis and appropriate treatment. This comprehensive guide covers the symptoms, causes, diagnostic methods, and current treatment options for heart failure.

## What is Heart Failure?

Heart failure occurs when the heart's pumping function is impaired, preventing organs and tissues from receiving adequate blood and oxygen. This condition is also known as "congestive heart failure" because it often presents with fluid accumulation (congestion) in the body.

Heart failure can develop suddenly (acute) or progress slowly (chronic). Chronic heart failure typically develops over years and may worsen over time.

### Types of Heart Failure

Heart failure is classified according to the affected heart chamber and pumping capacity:

**1. Left-Sided Heart Failure**

-   **HFrEF (Reduced Ejection Fraction):** Heart's pumping power is decreased (EF < 40%)
-   **HFpEF (Preserved Ejection Fraction):** Pumping power is normal but filling is impaired (EF ≥ 50%)
-   **HFmrEF (Mid-Range EF):** Ejection fraction between 40-49%

**2. Right-Sided Heart Failure**

-   The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs, but this function is impaired in right-sided failure
-   Usually develops secondary to left-sided heart failure

**3. Biventricular (Two-Sided) Failure**

-   Both left and right ventricles are affected
-   The most severe form with more serious prognosis

## Causes of Heart Failure

Many conditions and diseases can lead to heart failure:

### Primary Causes

**1. Coronary Artery Disease**

-   Most common cause (60-70%)
-   Reduced blood flow to heart muscle
-   Heart muscle damage following heart attack

**2. Hypertension (High Blood Pressure)**

-   Long-term high blood pressure strains the heart
-   Heart muscle thickens and stiffens
-   Pumping capacity decreases over time

**3. Heart Valve Diseases**

-   Stenosis or regurgitation increases heart workload
-   Aortic stenosis and mitral regurgitation are particularly important

**4. Cardiomyopathies**

-   **Dilated cardiomyopathy:** Heart enlarges and weakens
-   **Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy:** Heart muscle abnormally thickens
-   **Restrictive cardiomyopathy:** Heart walls stiffen

### Secondary and Contributing Factors

-   **Diabetes:** Micro and macrovascular complications
-   **Obesity:** Increases heart workload
-   **Sleep apnea:** Nighttime oxygen drops strain the heart
-   **Alcohol use:** Alcoholic cardiomyopathy
-   **Viral infections:** Myocarditis (heart muscle inflammation)
-   **Thyroid disorders:** Hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism
-   **Kidney failure:** Fluid and electrolyte imbalance
-   **Chemotherapy drugs:** Cardiotoxicity

## Heart Failure Symptoms

Heart failure symptoms vary depending on disease severity and affected heart region:

### Left-Sided Heart Failure Symptoms

**Shortness of Breath (Dyspnea)**

-   Begins with exertion, progresses to rest
-   Worsening breathlessness when lying down (orthopnea)
-   Sudden nighttime awakening with breathlessness (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea)

**Fatigue and Weakness**

-   Fatigue that limits daily activities
-   Muscle weakness
-   Difficulty concentrating

**Cough**

-   Dry, irritating cough
-   Cough worsening when lying down
-   Pink, frothy sputum in advanced cases

### Right-Sided Heart Failure Symptoms

**Peripheral Edema**

-   Swelling in ankles and legs
-   Edema increasing toward evening
-   Pitting when pressed with finger

**Abdominal Swelling**

-   Liver enlargement (hepatomegaly)
-   Fluid accumulation in abdomen (ascites)
-   Loss of appetite and nausea

**Neck Vein Distension**

-   Jugular venous distension (JVD)
-   More prominent when lying down

### NYHA Functional Classification

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification is used to assess clinical status:

| Class        | Definition                                                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Class I**  | No limitation of physical activity, normal activities don't cause symptoms |
| **Class II** | Slight activity limitation, dyspnea or fatigue with ordinary activities    |

## Diagnostic Methods

Heart failure diagnosis is made through a combination of clinical evaluation and various tests:

### Physical Examination

-   Heart and lung sounds (rales, murmurs, S3 gallop)
-   Checking for leg edema
-   Neck vein assessment
-   Liver size evaluation

### Laboratory Tests

**BNP/NT-proBNP**

-   Most important biomarker for heart failure
-   Valuable for diagnosis and monitoring
-   NT-proBNP > 125 pg/mL is significant

**Other Tests**

-   Complete blood count (anemia screening)
-   Kidney and liver function tests
-   Electrolytes (sodium, potassium)
-   Thyroid function tests
-   Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c

### Imaging Methods

**Echocardiography**

-   Gold standard diagnostic method
-   Ejection fraction measurement
-   Heart valve and wall motion assessment
-   Filling pressure estimation

**Chest X-Ray**

-   Cardiomegaly (heart enlargement)
-   Pulmonary congestion signs
-   Pleural effusion

**Coronary Angiography**

-   Coronary artery disease evaluation
-   Revascularization planning

**Cardiac MRI**

-   Myocardial structure and function
-   Fibrosis and scar tissue detection
-   Cardiomyopathy classification

### ECG (Electrocardiography)

-   Rhythm abnormalities
-   Conduction defects (left bundle branch block)
-   Previous infarction signs
-   Heart enlargement indicators

-   Effective in non-diabetic patients too
-   Reduces hospitalization

**5. Diuretics**

-   Removes fluid accumulation
-   Important for symptom control
-   Furosemide, torasemide

**6. ARNI (Sacubitril/Valsartan)**

-   Superior to ACE inhibitors in HFrEF
-   Reduces mortality and hospitalization

**7. Digoxin**

-   Heart rate control in atrial fibrillation patients
-   Symptom improvement

**8. Ivabradine**

-   For sinus rhythm with rate > 70/min
