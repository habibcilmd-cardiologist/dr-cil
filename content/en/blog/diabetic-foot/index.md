    - question: "Does diabetic foot completely heal?"
      answer: "Diabetic foot can completely heal if caught early and treated appropriately. However, complete healing may be difficult in advanced cases. The most important point is preventing complications through blood sugar control, regular foot care, and early intervention. The treatment process varies depending on the patient's general condition, wound depth, and presence of infection."
    - question: "How do I recognize a diabetic foot wound?"
      answer: "Due to nerve damage in diabetic feet, pain sensation may be reduced, so wounds may go unnoticed. Check your feet daily for redness, swelling, increased warmth, color changes, calluses, blisters, cuts, or cracks. Use a mirror to check the bottom of your feet. If you notice any changes, contact your doctor immediately."
    - question: "What shoes should I wear with diabetic foot?"
      answer: "Choose soft, flexible, wide-toed shoes. Shoes should not squeeze, rub, or create pressure points on your feet. Shoes made of leather or breathable materials are ideal. Avoid high heels, narrow-toed, or hard shoes. Break in new shoes gradually. Special diabetic shoes or orthopedic insoles may be needed."
    - question: "Why is foot care so important in diabetes?"
      answer: "Diabetes causes both nerve damage (neuropathy) and vascular damage (vasculopathy). Nerve damage reduces pain sensation, so minor injuries go unnoticed. Vascular damage impairs wound healing and increases infection risk. The combination of these two factors means even a small wound can lead to serious infection, gangrene, and amputation. Regular foot care significantly reduces these risks."
    - question: "How serious is diabetic foot infection?"
      answer: "Diabetic foot infections can be very serious and progress rapidly. Infection can spread to bone (osteomyelitis), enter the bloodstream (sepsis), and become life-threatening. Diabetic foot infections are more severe than in non-diabetic patients and more difficult to treat. Early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are vital. Symptoms like fever, chills, foul odor from wound, increased redness and swelling require emergency intervention."
    - question: "How does blood sugar control affect foot health?"
      answer: "Good blood sugar control is the most critical factor in preventing diabetic foot complications. High blood sugar accelerates nerve damage, weakens the immune system, impairs wound healing, and increases infection risk. HbA1c should be kept below 7%. Good control can be achieved through regular blood sugar monitoring, medication compliance, and lifestyle changes."
    - question: "What is the amputation risk in diabetic foot?"
      answer: "Diabetes is the most common cause of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations. However, 85% of amputations are preventable! Amputation risk can be significantly reduced through early diagnosis, regular foot examinations, proper foot care, good blood sugar control, and risk factor management. When wounds develop, early and aggressive treatment is critically important."
    - question: "How often should I see a doctor for diabetic foot?"
      answer: "Control frequency varies based on your risk level. Low-risk patients should have at least annual checks, moderate-risk patients every 3-6 months, high-risk patients (with previous wound or amputation history) every 1-3 months. More frequent follow-up is needed if there's an active wound. If you notice any changes, wounds, or signs of infection, contact your doctor immediately."
    - question: "Why is smoking dangerous in diabetic foot?"
      answer: "Smoking severely increases vascular damage, reduces blood flow, and impairs wound healing. Amputation risk is 2-3 times higher in diabetic patients who smoke. Smoking also increases infection risk and reduces treatment response. Quitting smoking is absolutely necessary for patients at risk of diabetic foot. Support programs and medication treatments are available for smoking cessation."
    - question: "How should I care for diabetic foot at home?"
      answer: "Wash your feet daily with lukewarm water (not hot!), dry gently, especially between toes. Apply moisturizing cream but not between toes. Cut nails straight, don't round corners. Wear thick socks, preferably seamless. Don't walk barefoot. Check your feet daily. Don't try to cut calluses yourself, seek professional help."

Diabetic foot is a serious complication that develops in diabetic patients and affects the feet. This condition, resulting from the combination of nerve damage (neuropathy) and vascular disease (vasculopathy), significantly increases the risk of wound formation, infection, and amputation. But the good news is that the vast majority of diabetic foot complications are preventable! In this comprehensive guide, I will discuss in detail what diabetic foot is, risk factors, symptoms, treatment methods, and most importantly, how it can be prevented.
{{< /lead >}}

## What is Diabetic Foot?

Diabetic foot describes a series of complications affecting the feet in diabetic patients. Prolonged high blood sugar leads to two main problems in the body:

1. **Peripheral Neuropathy (Nerve Damage):** High blood sugar damages nerves, especially affecting sensory nerves in the feet. This causes reduced or lost sensation of pain, temperature, and pressure.

2. **Peripheral Vasculopathy (Vascular Disease):** Diabetes causes narrowing and blockage of blood vessels going to the feet. This leads to insufficient oxygen and nutrients reaching tissues and impaired wound healing.

The combination of these two factors forms the basis of diabetic foot. Due to nerve damage, patients cannot feel minor injuries, stones in shoes, or pressure points. Vascular disease makes wound healing difficult and increases infection risk.

### Importance and Prevalence of Diabetic Foot

Diabetic foot is a serious problem for both patients and the healthcare system:

-   **Prevalence:** 15-25% of diabetic patients develop foot wounds during their lifetime
-   **Amputation:** 50-70% of non-traumatic lower extremity amputations are due to diabetes
-   **Mortality:** 5-year mortality after major amputation is 50-70%
-   **Cost:** Diabetic foot treatment is expensive and time-consuming
-   **Quality of Life:** Foot problems seriously affect mobility, independence, and quality of life

But the encouraging fact is: **85% of diabetic foot complications are preventable!**

## Diabetic Foot Risk Factors

Some diabetic patients are at higher risk for diabetic foot:

### High Risk Factors

-   **Previous foot wound or amputation history:** Most important risk factor
-   **Peripheral neuropathy:** Loss of protective sensation
-   **Peripheral artery disease:** Weak or absent pulses in feet
-   **Foot deformities:** Hammer toe, bunion, Charcot foot
-   **Visual impairment:** Makes foot inspection difficult
-   **Chronic kidney disease:** Especially dialysis patients
-   **Poor blood sugar control:** HbA1c >8%

### Moderate Risk Factors

-   **Presence of peripheral neuropathy** (without wound history)
-   **Peripheral artery disease** (without wound history)
-   **Foot deformities**
-   **Callus or callosity formation**

### Low Risk Factors

-   **Normal sensory function**
-   **Palpable pulses**
-   **No deformity**

### Other Important Risk Factors

-   **Smoking:** Increases vascular damage, impairs wound healing
-   **Old age:** Risk increases after 60
-   **Long diabetes duration:** Diabetes longer than 10 years
-   **Male gender:** Slightly more common in men

**Grade 0:** No wound, but risk factors present (neuropathy, deformity)

**Grade 1:** Superficial ulcer, not reaching deep tissues

**Grade 2:** Deep ulcer, reaching tendon, bone, or joint capsule

**Grade 3:** Deep ulcer + abscess, osteomyelitis, or joint infection

**Grade 4:** Limited gangrene (forefoot or heel)

**Grade 5:** Extensive gangrene (entire foot)

### University of Texas Classification

A more detailed classification system that evaluates wound depth and presence of infection/ischemia together.

## Treatment Approaches

Diabetic foot treatment requires a multidisciplinary approach and is personalized according to the patient's condition:

### 1. Blood Sugar Control

The most fundamental and critical step of treatment:

-   **HbA1c target:** <7% (can be individualized)
-   **Regular blood sugar monitoring**
-   **Medication therapy optimization:** Insulin, oral antidiabetics
-   **Dietary regulation**
-   **Regular exercise program**

Good glycemic control:

-   Accelerates wound healing
-   Reduces infection risk
-   Slows neuropathy and vasculopathy progression
-   Improves general health status

### 2. Wound Care

**Debridement (Dead Tissue Removal):**

-   Removal of necrotic (dead) tissues
-   Removal of callus and hyperkeratotic tissues
-   May need to be repeated at regular intervals
-   Surgical, mechanical, or enzymatic methods

**Wound Cleaning:**

-   Daily wound cleaning
-   Use of sterile saline solution
-   Antiseptic solutions (careful use)

**Wound Dressings:**

-   Dressings that maintain moisture balance
-   Hydrocolloid, hydrogel, foam dressings
-   Silver-containing dressings (if infection present)
-   Negative pressure wound therapy (VAC)

**Pressure Relief (Offloading):**

-   **Most important treatment component!**
-   Total Contact Cast (TCC): Gold standard
-   Removable walking boots
-   Special shoes and insoles
-   Crutch or wheelchair use

{{< alert "warning" >}}
**Important:** Pressure relief (offloading) is the most critical component of diabetic foot wound treatment. If pressure on the wound continues, even the best wound care will fail.

### 4. Vascular Treatment

If vascular disease is present, revascularization (vessel opening) may be needed:

**Endovascular Treatment:**

-   Balloon angioplasty
-   Stent placement
-   Atherectomy
-   Minimally invasive, rapid recovery

**Surgical Bypass:**

-   For long segment blockages
-   In cases not suitable for endovascular treatment
-   Use of vein or synthetic graft

### 5. Advanced Treatment Methods

-   High-pressure oxygen therapy
-   Can accelerate wound healing
-   Used in selected cases

**Biological Therapies:**

-   Growth factors (PDGF)
-   Skin grafts and skin substitutes
-   Stem cell therapy (experimental)

**Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (VAC):**

-   Vacuum application to wound
-   Increases granulation tissue
-   Reduces edema and infection

### 6. Surgical Treatment

**Minor Amputations:**

-   Toe amputation
-   Transmetatarsal amputation
-   Attempts to preserve foot function

**Major Amputations:**

-   Below knee (BKA - Below Knee Amputation)
-   Above knee (AKA - Above Knee Amputation)
-   Can be life-saving
-   Rehabilitation and prosthesis application

**Charcot Foot Surgery:**

-   Bone and joint reconstruction
-   Stabilization surgery

## Prevention of Diabetic Foot

Most diabetic foot complications are preventable! Here are prevention strategies:

### Daily Foot Care

**Check Your Feet Every Day:**

-   Use a mirror to check the bottom of your feet
-   Look for redness, swelling, cuts, blisters, calluses
-   Check between toes
-   Pay attention to color changes
