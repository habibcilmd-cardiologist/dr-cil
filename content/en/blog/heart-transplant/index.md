faq:
- question: Is medication necessary after heart transplant?
  answer: Yes, lifelong immunosuppressive medication is required. These drugs prevent the body from rejecting the new heart.
- question: How long is the heart transplant waiting time?
  answer: Waiting time is variable. It depends on urgency, blood type, and finding a suitable donor. It can range from a few weeks to several years.
- question: Is normal life possible after heart transplant?
  answer: Yes, many patients can return to near-normal life. They can work, travel, and engage in physical activities.
- question: Is there an age limit for heart transplant?
  answer: Generally, over 70 years is considered a relative contraindication, but biological age is more important. The transplant team makes the decision.
- question: How long does heart transplant surgery take?
  answer: Surgery usually takes 4-8 hours. This includes the entire process of preparing and placing the donor heart.
- question: Can I exercise after heart transplant?
  answer: Yes, light to moderate intensity exercise can be performed after the recovery period. There are even patients who participate in transplant games.
- question: How is heart transplant rejection detected?
  answer: Symptoms may include shortness of breath, fatigue, swelling, fever, and changes in heart rate. Early detection is possible with regular biopsies.

Heart transplant is a life-saving surgical procedure performed in end-stage heart failure. This method, used when all treatment options are exhausted, offers a new chance at life for many patients. In this guide, we detail the heart transplant process, waiting list, post-surgery life, and important considerations.

## What is Heart Transplant?

Heart transplant (cardiac transplantation) is removing the diseased heart and replacing it with a healthy heart from a brain-dead donor. It is the last resort treatment in end-stage heart failure when other treatments are insufficient.

The first successful heart transplant was performed in 1967 in South Africa by Dr. Christiaan Barnard. Since then, surgical techniques and immunosuppressive therapies have made significant progress.

**Types of Heart Transplant:**

-   **Orthotopic heart transplant:** The standard method. The patient's heart is removed and the donor heart is placed in the same position.
-   **Heterotopic heart transplant:** A rarely used method. The donor heart is placed alongside the patient's own heart.

## Who is Eligible for Heart Transplant?

### Definite Indications

-   **End-stage heart failure:** Patients with very low EF (ejection fraction) despite all treatments
-   **Refractory cardiogenic shock:** Shock not responding to medications and mechanical support
-   **Treatment-resistant ventricular arrhythmias:** Arrhythmias not controlled despite ICD and ablation
-   **Congenital heart disease:** Congenital heart anomalies that cannot be surgically corrected

### Evaluation Criteria

Heart transplant candidates undergo comprehensive evaluation:

-   **VO2 max <12-14 ml/kg/min:** Severe reduction in exercise capacity
-   **Ejection fraction <20%:** Critical reduction in heart pumping power
-   **Recurrent hospitalizations:** Multiple hospitalizations for heart failure in the last year
-   **Inotropic dependence:** Inability to survive without medications

## Heart Transplant Contraindications

### Absolute Contraindications (Cannot Be Performed)

-   Active infection (uncontrollable)
-   Active cancer
-   Irreversible pulmonary hypertension
-   Severe peripheral or cerebrovascular disease
-   Active substance abuse

### Relative Contraindications

-   Advanced age (>70)
-   Morbid obesity (BMI >35)
-   Complicated diabetes
-   Severe kidney or liver disease
-   Psychosocial problems or history of non-compliance

## Heart Transplant Process

### 1. Evaluation Phase

A comprehensive evaluation process is applied:

-   **Cardiac tests:** Echocardiography, coronary angiography, right heart catheterization
-   **Pulmonary evaluation:** Lung function tests, pulmonary vascular resistance measurement
-   **Laboratory:** Blood type determination, HLA typing, infection screening
-   **Psychiatric evaluation:** Compliance and support system evaluation
-   **Social services evaluation:** Family support, financial situation

### 2. Waiting List

Patients who pass the evaluation are placed on the national organ transplant waiting list:

-   **Urgency status:** Ranking by UNOS system (1A, 1B, 2, etc.)
-   **Blood type compatibility:** Required
-   **Tissue compatibility:** HLA matching
-   **Body size:** Donor-recipient match
-   **Geographic proximity:** Organ transport time is critical

### 3. Surgery

The surgical process begins when a suitable donor is found:

1. **Donor heart procurement:** From a brain-dead donor whose family has given consent
2. **Heart preservation:** Cooled and transported with special preservation solutions
3. **Removal of patient's heart:** With cardiopulmonary bypass support
4. **Placement of new heart:** Connection of aorta, pulmonary artery, and atria
5. **Starting the heart:** Electrical stimulation and resuscitation

### Surgery Duration

Total duration: **4-8 hours**

## Life After Heart Transplant

### Immunosuppressive Therapy

Lifelong medication is required to prevent the body from rejecting the new heart:

-   **Calcineurin inhibitors:** Tacrolimus or cyclosporine
-   **Antiproliferative agents:** Mycophenolate mofetil
-   **Corticosteroids:** Prednisolone (may be reduced over time)

{{< alert "warning" >}}
**Important!** Taking immunosuppressive medications regularly and at the correct dose is vital. Never stop or change the dose of your medications on your own.

### Follow-up Program

Close follow-up is essential after transplant:

-   **Endomyocardial biopsy:** Frequent in the first year, then annually
-   **Echocardiography:** At regular intervals
-   **Coronary angiography:** Annually (transplant vasculopathy screening)
-   **Laboratory tests:** Drug levels, kidney and liver functions

### Possible Complications

-   **Acute rejection:** Most common in the first year, early detection with biopsy
-   **Infections:** Risk increases due to immunosuppression
-   **Transplant vasculopathy:** Chronic damage to coronary arteries
-   **Malignancy:** Slightly increased cancer risk in the long term
-   **Kidney failure:** Drug-related

## Heart Transplant Results

### Quality of Life

In the majority of patients after successful heart transplant:

-   Symptoms significantly improve
-   Exercise capacity increases
-   Return to normal social life is achieved
-   Work life can continue
-   Travel is possible

## LVAD: Bridge to Heart Transplant

Left ventricular assist device (LVAD) can be used as "bridge therapy" in patients waiting for heart transplant. It helps the patient survive until a suitable donor is found.

In some patients, LVAD can also be applied as permanent treatment (destination therapy).
