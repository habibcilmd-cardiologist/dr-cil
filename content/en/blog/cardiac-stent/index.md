faq:
- question: Is the stent permanent?
  answer: Yes, metal stents are permanent. Bioresorbable stents dissolve over time.
- question: How long is medication required after stent?
  answer: Dual antiplatelet therapy usually lasts 6-12 months. Aspirin continues for life.
- question: Can I have MRI after stent?
  answer: Yes, modern stents are MRI compatible.
- question: Can I exercise after stent?
  answer: Yes, regular exercise is recommended after recovery.
- question: Can the stent become blocked?
  answer: Rarely occurs. Medication compliance and lifestyle modification are important.

## What is a Cardiac Stent?

A cardiac stent is a cylindrical metal mesh that keeps the vessel open after balloon angioplasty. It adheres to the vessel wall and prevents recurrence of stenosis.

**Stent Types:**

-   Bare metal stent (BMS)
-   Drug-eluting stent (DES)
-   Bioresorbable stent

## Cardiac Stent Indications

### Acute Coronary Syndrome

-   ST-elevation myocardial infarction
-   Non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction
-   Unstable angina

### Stable Coronary Artery Disease

-   Severe stenosis (>70%)
-   Symptomatic patients
-   Positive stress test
-   Unresponsive to medical therapy

## Stent Types

### Bare Metal Stent (BMS)

-   First generation stents
-   Higher restenosis rate
-   Short-term antiplatelet therapy

### Drug-Eluting Stent (DES)

-   Antiproliferative drug coated
-   Low restenosis rate
-   Long-term antiplatelet therapy
-   Current standard

### Bioresorbable Stent

-   Structure that dissolves over time
-   Vessel function preserved
-   In selected patients

## How is Stent Implantation Performed?

### Preparation

-   Evaluation with angiography
-   Antiplatelet loading
-   Hydration

### Procedure Steps

1. **Vascular access**: Femoral or radial
2. **Guide catheter**: To coronary ostium
3. **Guidewire**: Through lesion
4. **Predilation**: With balloon
5. **Stent placement**: Over lesion
6. **Stent deployment**: Balloon inflation
7. **Postdilation**: If needed
8. **Control angiography**: Result evaluation

### Procedure Duration

Total time: 30-90 minutes

## Post-Stent Treatment

### Antiplatelet Therapy

**Dual Antiplatelet Therapy (DAPT):**

-   Aspirin + P2Y12 inhibitor
-   Duration: 6-12 months (DES)
-   Duration: 1-3 months (BMS)

### Other Medications

-   Statin
-   Beta blocker
-   ACE inhibitor
-   Nitrate (if needed)

## Stent Complications

### Early Complications

-   Stent thrombosis
-   Dissection
-   Perforation

### Late Complications

-   In-stent restenosis
-   Late stent thrombosis
-   Neoatherosclerosis
