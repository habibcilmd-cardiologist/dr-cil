faq:
- question: What is carotid endarterectomy?
  answer: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure to remove atherosclerotic
    plaque buildup from the inner lining of the carotid (neck) artery. This surgery
    increases blood flow to the brain and significantly reduces the risk of stroke.
- question: Who is a candidate for carotid endarterectomy?
  answer: Carotid endarterectomy is typically recommended for symptomatic patients
    with 70 percent or greater carotid artery stenosis, patients who have had a transient
    ischemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke, and some high-risk asymptomatic patients
    with stenosis above 60 percent. The patient's overall health, age, and risk factors
    are determining factors in treatment decisions.
- question: How is carotid endarterectomy performed?
  answer: The surgery is performed under general or local anesthesia. An incision
    is made on the side of the neck to access the carotid artery. The artery is temporarily
    clamped and opened, and the atherosclerotic plaque is removed. The artery is usually
    closed with a patch (patch angioplasty) to widen it, and blood flow is restored.
    The procedure takes approximately one to two hours.
- question: What is the difference between carotid endarterectomy and carotid stenting?
  answer: Carotid endarterectomy is an open surgical procedure involving physical
    removal of plaque. Carotid artery stenting (CAS) is a minimally invasive procedure
    where a stent is placed at the narrowing through a catheter inserted from the
    groin. Endarterectomy generally has better long-term outcomes, especially in older
    patients and those with calcified plaques. Stenting may be preferred in patients
    with high surgical risk.
- question: What are the risks of carotid endarterectomy?
  answer: Like any surgical procedure, carotid endarterectomy has some risks. These
    include stroke during or after surgery, heart attack, cranial nerve injury (hoarseness,
    swallowing difficulty), neck bleeding or hematoma, wound infection, and restenosis
    (re-narrowing of the artery). In experienced centers, these complication rates
    are quite low.
- question: What is the recovery process after carotid endarterectomy?
  answer: Patients typically stay in the hospital for one to three days. Wound care
    is simple, and sutures are removed after about one week. Most patients can return
    to normal daily activities within one to two weeks. Continuing medication (antiplatelet,
    statin), controlling risk factors, and regular follow-up are important. Heavy
    physical activities should be avoided for several weeks.
- question: How much does carotid endarterectomy reduce stroke risk?
  answer: Clinical studies have shown that carotid endarterectomy reduces stroke risk
    by approximately 50 to 60 percent in symptomatic patients with carotid stenosis.
    In asymptomatic patients, the five-year stroke risk is also significantly lower
    compared to medical therapy alone. The success of the surgery depends on the patient's
    condition, degree of stenosis, and surgeon experience.
- question: Can medication alone be sufficient instead of carotid endarterectomy?
  answer: In some cases, especially with lower-grade stenosis or patients with very
    high surgical risk, aggressive medical therapy (antiplatelet drugs, statins, blood
    pressure control, smoking cessation) may be the primary choice. However, for severe
    stenosis and symptomatic patients, surgery or stenting is generally superior to
    medical therapy. Treatment decisions should be individualized based on the patient's
    specific situation.

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is a surgical procedure to remove atherosclerotic plaque buildup from the inner wall of the carotid artery in the neck. This surgery prevents blockage of blood flow to the brain and significantly reduces the risk of stroke. This comprehensive guide covers what carotid endarterectomy is, who is a candidate, how it is performed, its risks, and alternatives.

## What Is Carotid Endarterectomy?

Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) is the surgical removal of atherosclerotic plaque from inside the carotid artery, one of the main arteries in the neck. These plaques are accumulations of cholesterol, calcium, and fibrous tissue that cause narrowing of the artery over time.

### The Importance of the Carotid Artery

The carotid arteries are the two main arteries that carry oxygen-rich blood pumped by the heart to the brain. Each runs along either side of the neck and supplies different parts of the brain:

**Right and Left Common Carotid Arteries:**
- Arise from the aorta and travel upward through the neck
- Each divides into internal and external carotid arteries

**Internal Carotid Artery:**
- Supplies the front and middle portions of the brain
- Critical for vision, motor functions, and cognitive processes
- High risk of stroke in case of narrowing or blockage

**External Carotid Artery:**
- Supplies the face, scalp, and neck structures
- Less critical compared to the internal carotid

### Atherosclerosis and Carotid Stenosis

Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease characterized by plaque buildup on the inner surface of blood vessels. When atherosclerosis develops in the carotid arteries:

**Plaque Formation:**
- Cholesterol and fatty substances accumulate on the vessel wall
- Inflammatory cells migrate to the area
- Smooth muscle cells proliferate
- Calcium deposition begins
- A fibrous cap forms

**Stenosis Development:**
- As plaque grows, the vessel lumen (inner diameter) narrows
- Blood flow becomes restricted
- Turbulent flow develops
- Conditions favorable for clot formation are created

**Complications:**
- Plaque rupture and clot formation on top of it
- Clot or plaque fragments breaking off and traveling to the brain (embolism)
- Insufficient blood flow to the brain due to critical stenosis

## Stroke and Carotid Disease Relationship

Stroke is among the leading causes of death and permanent disability worldwide. Carotid disease is responsible for approximately 20 to 30 percent of ischemic strokes.

### Stroke Mechanisms

**Embolic Stroke:**
- Fragments breaking off from carotid plaque block brain vessels
- The most common mechanism
- Presents with sudden onset neurological deficits

**Hemodynamic Stroke:**
- Insufficient blood flow to the brain in severe carotid stenosis
- Usually triggered by low blood pressure or cardiac arrhythmias
- Watershed infarcts may occur

### Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA)

TIA, also known as a "mini-stroke" in common parlance:

**Characteristics:**
- Temporary loss of brain function
- Symptoms completely resolve within 24 hours (usually within minutes or a few hours)
- Does not leave permanent brain damage

**Significance:**
- May herald an impending major stroke
- Stroke risk within 90 days after TIA can be as high as 10 to 20 percent
- Requires urgent evaluation and treatment

**Symptoms:**
- Sudden arm or leg weakness, numbness
- Speech disturbance
- Vision loss (especially in one eye)
- Loss of balance, dizziness
- Sudden severe headache

## Indications for Carotid Endarterectomy

The decision for surgery is made based on the patient's symptoms, degree of stenosis, and overall health status.

### Symptomatic Patients

A symptomatic patient is one who has experienced TIA or stroke due to carotid stenosis:

**Definite Indications:**
- Symptomatic patients with 70 to 99 percent carotid stenosis
- Recurrent TIA or stroke despite medical therapy
- Expected benefit from the procedure must outweigh surgical risk

**Relative Indications:**
- Symptomatic patients with 50 to 69 percent stenosis (requires individual evaluation)
- Plaque morphology (ulcerated, soft plaques) is considered

### Asymptomatic Patients

Patients with severe carotid stenosis detected but no symptoms:

**Indications:**
- 60 to 70 percent or greater stenosis
- Expected life expectancy must be more than 5 years
- Surgical risk must be low (complication rate below 3 percent)
- Plaque characteristics (progression, ulceration) must be evaluated

**Considerations:**
- Surgical benefit is more limited in asymptomatic patients
- Effectiveness of modern medical therapy has improved
- Individualized decision-making is important

## Preoperative Evaluation

### Diagnostic Imaging

**Carotid Doppler Ultrasonography:**
- First-line screening and follow-up method
- Evaluates degree of stenosis and plaque characteristics
- Non-invasive and radiation-free
- Repeatable and inexpensive

**CT Angiography:**
- Shows degree of stenosis, plaque structure, and anatomical variations
- Valuable for surgical planning
- Contrast agent and radiation exposure are disadvantages

**MR Angiography:**
- Radiation-free alternative
- Non-contrast techniques available
- Plaque characterization possible
- Attention needed for metal implants and claustrophobia limitations

**Conventional Angiography:**
- Rarely needed for diagnosis anymore
- May be used for endovascular procedure planning

### Cardiac Evaluation

A significant proportion of patients with carotid disease also have coronary artery disease:

**Recommended Evaluations:**
- Electrocardiography (ECG)
- Echocardiography (if needed)
- Stress testing or coronary angiography (in high-risk patients)

### Risk Assessment

**High Surgical Risk Criteria:**
- Advanced age (over 80 years)
- Severe heart disease
- Uncontrolled diabetes
- Chronic kidney disease
- Severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
- Contralateral carotid occlusion
- Previous neck surgery or radiotherapy

## Surgical Technique

### Anesthesia

**General Anesthesia:**
- Most commonly preferred method
- Patient is fully sedated
- Airway control is maintained
- Cerebral monitoring (EEG, oximetry) may be used

**Regional (Local) Anesthesia:**
- Performed with cervical block
- Patient is awake and neurological assessment can be done
- Advantage of early detection of cerebral ischemia
- Requires patient cooperation

### Surgical Steps

**Preparation:**
- Patient is placed supine, head turned to the opposite side
- Neck area is prepared in a sterile manner
- Cleansed with antiseptic solution

**Incision and Exposure:**
- Oblique incision made along the anterior border of sternocleidomastoid muscle
- Muscle and soft tissues are dissected
- Common carotid, internal and external carotid arteries are exposed
- Cranial nerves (hypoglossal, vagus, superior laryngeal) are protected

**Vascular Control:**
- Systemic heparin is administered (to prevent blood clotting)
- Common carotid, internal and external carotid arteries are clamped
- Cerebral blood flow is maintained via shunt or contralateral carotid

**Arteriotomy and Plaque Removal:**
- Carotid artery is opened longitudinally
- Atherosclerotic plaque is carefully separated from the vessel wall
- Plaque is completely removed from common carotid to internal carotid
- Inner surface of vessel is smoothed
- Residual plaque fragments are cleared

**Vessel Closure:**
- Primary closure or
- Closure with patch angioplasty (synthetic or autogenous vein)
- Patch use reduces restenosis risk

**Restoring Blood Flow:**
- Air and debris cleared before unclamping
- Clamp sequence opened carefully
- Bleeding control performed
- Hemodynamic stability ensured

**Closure:**
- Layers closed anatomically
- Drain may be placed (for bleeding control)
- Skin closed with sutures or staples

### Shunt Use

A shunt is a temporary tube used to maintain blood flow to the brain during surgery:

**Indications:**
- Contralateral carotid occlusion
- Inadequate Circle of Willis
- Signs of cerebral ischemia on shunt monitoring
- Neurological changes under local anesthesia

**Advantages:**
- Preserves cerebral perfusion
- May reduce stroke risk

**Disadvantages:**
- Technically more difficult
- Risk of vessel damage
- Risk of embolism

## Alternative Treatment Options

### Carotid Artery Stenting (CAS)

Carotid stenting is a minimally invasive alternative to carotid endarterectomy:

**Procedure:**
- Access through the groin artery (femoral artery) via catheter
- Stenosis area expanded with balloon
- Metal mesh stent placed
- Embolic protection devices used

**Advantages:**
- No neck incision required
- Anesthesia risk may be lower
- Shorter hospital stay
- May be preferred in patients with prior neck surgery

**Disadvantages:**
- Long-term outcomes generally less successful than endarterectomy
- Risk of embolism during procedure
- In-stent restenosis may develop
- Risk may be higher in elderly patients

**Preferred Situations:**
- Patients with high surgical risk
- Prior neck surgery or radiotherapy
- Anatomically high lesion location
- Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy

### Medical Therapy

Medical therapy can be applied in addition to or instead of surgery or stenting:

**Antiplatelet Therapy:**
- Aspirin (75-100 mg/day) is the cornerstone
- Clopidogrel may be used as alternative or addition
- Dual antiplatelet therapy recommended in some cases

**Statin Therapy:**
- Lowers LDL cholesterol
- Provides plaque stabilization
- Has anti-inflammatory effects
- High-intensity statin therapy recommended

**Blood Pressure Control:**
- Target generally below 130/80 mmHg
- ACE inhibitors or ARBs preferred
- Excessive hypotension should be avoided

**Risk Factor Modification:**
- Smoking cessation (the most critical step)
- Diabetes control (HbA1c target below 7 percent)
- Weight control
- Regular physical activity
- Healthy diet (Mediterranean diet)

## Complications and Risks

### Perioperative Complications

**Stroke:**
- The most feared complication
- Rate is around 1 to 3 percent in experienced centers
- May be due to embolism, hypoperfusion, or intracerebral hemorrhage
- Risk is somewhat higher in symptomatic patients

**Heart Attack:**
- Risk exists since coronary artery disease often coexists
- Rate is around 1 to 2 percent
- Preoperative cardiac evaluation is important

**Cranial Nerve Injury:**
- Hypoglossal nerve (tongue movement): 5 to 8 percent
- Vagus nerve (hoarseness): 3 to 5 percent

- Most are temporary; permanent damage is rare

**Neck Hematoma:**
- Rate is around 5 to 7 percent
- May threaten airway in severe cases
- May require emergency surgical intervention

**Wound Infection:**
- Rate is below 1 percent
- Can be prevented with antibiotic prophylaxis

### Late Complications

**Restenosis (Re-narrowing):**
- Occurs in 5 to 10 percent within first two years
- Risk reduced with patch angioplasty
- Usually asymptomatic
- Followed with Doppler ultrasound

**Pseudoaneurysm:**
- Vessel wall ballooning at surgical site
- Rare; may require surgical repair

**Contralateral Carotid Disease:**
- Atherosclerosis is a systemic disease
- Contralateral carotid should also be monitored

## Postoperative Care and Recovery

### Hospital Stay

**First 24 Hours:**

- Carotid monitoring with Doppler ultrasound

## Outcomes and Success Rates

### Short-Term Outcomes

**Mortality:**
- Below 1 percent in experienced centers
- May be slightly higher in symptomatic patients

**Combined Stroke and Death Rate:**
- 3 to 6 percent in symptomatic patients
- 1 to 3 percent in asymptomatic patients

### Long-Term Outcomes

**Stroke Prevention:**
- Stroke risk reduced by more than half in symptomatic 70+ percent stenosis
- Significant benefit also achieved in asymptomatic patients
- Effect persists for years

**Survival:**
- Life expectancy normal after successful surgery
- Coronary artery disease is the main cause of death
- Risk factor control improves survival

**Clinical Study Data:**
